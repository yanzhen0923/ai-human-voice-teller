ON THE CONTRARY IT GAVE HIM A PUBLICLY CONFESSED STANDING IN THAT SPHERE AND AS MISTER VERLOC HAD UNCONFESSED RELATIONS WHICH MADE HIM FAMILIAR WITH YET CARELESS OF THE POLICE THERE WAS A DISTINCT ADVANTAGE IN SUCH A SITUATION. BUT AS A MEANS OF LIVELIHOOD IT WAS BY ITSELF INSUFFICIENT. HE TOOK THE CASH BOX OUT OF THE DRAWER AND TURNING TO LEAVE THE SHOP BECAME AWARE THAT STEVIE WAS STILL DOWNSTAIRS. WHAT ON EARTH IS HE DOING THERE MISTER VERLOC ASKED HIMSELF WHAT'S THE MEANING OF THESE ANTICS. HE LOOKED DUBIOUSLY AT HIS BROTHER IN LAW BUT HE DID NOT ASK HIM FOR INFORMATION. MISTER VERLOC PERCEIVED WITH SOME SURPRISE THAT HE DID NOT KNOW REALLY WHAT TO SAY TO STEVIE. HE STOOD STILL IN THE MIDDLE OF THE PARLOUR AND LOOKED INTO THE KITCHEN IN SILENCE. AND THIS APPEARED VERY QUEER TO MISTER VERLOC IN VIEW OF THE FACT BORNE UPON HIM SUDDENLY THAT HE HAD TO PROVIDE FOR THIS FELLOW TOO. HE HAD NEVER GIVEN A MOMENT'S THOUGHT TILL THEN TO THAT ASPECT OF STEVIE'S EXISTENCE. HE WATCHED HIM GESTICULATING AND MURMURING IN THE KITCHEN. STEVIE PROWLED ROUND THE TABLE LIKE AN EXCITED ANIMAL IN A CAGE. A TENTATIVE HADN'T YOU BETTER GO TO BED NOW. PRODUCED NO EFFECT WHATEVER AND MISTER VERLOC ABANDONING THE STONY CONTEMPLATION OF HIS BROTHER IN LAW'S BEHAVIOUR CROSSED THE PARLOUR WEARILY CASH BOX IN HAND. THE CAUSE OF THE GENERAL LASSITUDE HE FELT WHILE CLIMBING THE STAIRS BEING PURELY MENTAL HE BECAME ALARMED BY ITS INEXPLICABLE CHARACTER. HE HOPED HE WAS NOT SICKENING FOR ANYTHING. MISSUS VERLOC HAD FALLEN ASLEEP WITH THE LAMP NO GAS WAS LAID UPSTAIRS TURNED UP FULL ON THE TABLE BY THE SIDE OF THE BED. THE LIGHT THROWN DOWN BY THE SHADE FELL DAZZLINGLY ON THE WHITE PILLOW SUNK BY THE WEIGHT OF HER HEAD REPOSING WITH CLOSED EYES AND DARK HAIR DONE UP IN SEVERAL PLAITS FOR THE NIGHT. HER BARE FEET AS IF POKED THROUGH THE BOTTOM OF AN UNADORNED SLEEVED CALICO SACK BUTTONED TIGHTLY AT NECK AND WRISTS FELT OVER THE RUG FOR THE SLIPPERS WHILE SHE LOOKED UPWARD INTO HER HUSBAND'S FACE. I DON'T KNOW HOW TO MANAGE HIM MISTER VERLOC EXPLAINED PEEVISHLY. WON'T DO TO LEAVE HIM DOWNSTAIRS ALONE WITH THE LIGHTS. SHE SAID NOTHING GLIDED ACROSS THE ROOM SWIFTLY AND THE DOOR CLOSED UPON HER WHITE FORM. MISTER VERLOC DEPOSITED THE CASH BOX ON THE NIGHT TABLE AND BEGAN THE OPERATION OF UNDRESSING BY FLINGING HIS OVERCOAT ON TO A DISTANT CHAIR. HIS COAT AND WAISTCOAT FOLLOWED. HE WALKED ABOUT THE ROOM IN HIS STOCKINGED FEET AND HIS BURLY FIGURE WITH THE HANDS WORRYING NERVOUSLY AT HIS THROAT PASSED AND REPASSED ACROSS THE LONG STRIP OF LOOKING GLASS IN THE DOOR OF HIS WIFE'S WARDROBE. MISTER VERLOC FELT THE LATENT UNFRIENDLINESS OF ALL OUT OF DOORS WITH A FORCE APPROACHING TO POSITIVE BODILY ANGUISH. THERE IS NO OCCUPATION THAT FAILS A MAN MORE COMPLETELY THAN THAT OF A SECRET AGENT OF POLICE. IT'S LIKE YOUR HORSE SUDDENLY FALLING DEAD UNDER YOU IN THE MIDST OF AN UNINHABITED AND THIRSTY PLAIN. THE COMPARISON OCCURRED TO MISTER VERLOC BECAUSE HE HAD SAT ASTRIDE VARIOUS ARMY HORSES IN HIS TIME AND HAD NOW THE SENSATION OF AN INCIPIENT FALL. THE PROSPECT WAS AS BLACK AS THE WINDOW PANE AGAINST WHICH HE WAS LEANING HIS FOREHEAD. THIS LUMINOUS AND MUTILATED VISION WAS SO GHASTLY PHYSICALLY THAT MISTER VERLOC STARTED AWAY FROM THE WINDOW LETTING DOWN THE VENETIAN BLIND WITH A GREAT RATTLE. DISCOMPOSED AND SPEECHLESS WITH THE APPREHENSION OF MORE SUCH VISIONS HE BEHELD HIS WIFE RE ENTER THE ROOM AND GET INTO BED IN A CALM BUSINESS LIKE MANNER WHICH MADE HIM FEEL HOPELESSLY LONELY IN THE WORLD. MISSUS VERLOC EXPRESSED HER SURPRISE AT SEEING HIM UP YET. I DON'T FEEL VERY WELL HE MUTTERED PASSING HIS HANDS OVER HIS MOIST BROW GIDDINESS. YES NOT AT ALL WELL. DOWN BELOW IN THE QUIET NARROW STREET MEASURED FOOTSTEPS APPROACHED THE HOUSE THEN DIED AWAY UNHURRIED AND FIRM AS IF THE PASSER BY HAD STARTED TO PACE OUT ALL ETERNITY FROM GAS LAMP TO GAS LAMP IN A NIGHT WITHOUT END AND THE DROWSY TICKING OF THE OLD CLOCK ON THE LANDING BECAME DISTINCTLY AUDIBLE IN THE BEDROOM. MISSUS VERLOC ON HER BACK AND STARING AT THE CEILING MADE A REMARK TAKINGS VERY SMALL TO DAY
