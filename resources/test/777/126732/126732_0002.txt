THE ALL BUT MORIBUND VETERAN OF DYNAMITE WARS HAD BEEN A GREAT ACTOR IN HIS TIME ACTOR ON PLATFORMS IN SECRET ASSEMBLIES IN PRIVATE INTERVIEWS. THE FAMOUS TERRORIST HAD NEVER IN HIS LIFE RAISED PERSONALLY AS MUCH AS HIS LITTLE FINGER AGAINST THE SOCIAL EDIFICE. WITH A MORE SUBTLE INTENTION HE TOOK THE PART OF AN INSOLENT AND VENOMOUS EVOKER OF SINISTER IMPULSES WHICH LURK IN THE BLIND ENVY AND EXASPERATED VANITY OF IGNORANCE IN THE SUFFERING AND MISERY OF POVERTY IN ALL THE HOPEFUL AND NOBLE ILLUSIONS OF RIGHTEOUS ANGER PITY AND REVOLT. THE SHADOW OF HIS EVIL GIFT CLUNG TO HIM YET LIKE THE SMELL OF A DEADLY DRUG IN AN OLD VIAL OF POISON EMPTIED NOW USELESS READY TO BE THROWN AWAY UPON THE RUBBISH HEAP OF THINGS THAT HAD SERVED THEIR TIME. MICHAELIS THE TICKET OF LEAVE APOSTLE SMILED VAGUELY WITH HIS GLUED LIPS HIS PASTY MOON FACE DROOPED UNDER THE WEIGHT OF MELANCHOLY ASSENT. HE HAD BEEN A PRISONER HIMSELF. HIS OWN SKIN HAD SIZZLED UNDER THE RED HOT BRAND HE MURMURED SOFTLY. BUT COMRADE OSSIPON NICKNAMED THE DOCTOR HAD GOT OVER THE SHOCK BY THAT TIME. YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND HE BEGAN DISDAINFULLY BUT STOPPED SHORT INTIMIDATED BY THE DEAD BLACKNESS OF THE CAVERNOUS EYES IN THE FACE TURNED SLOWLY TOWARDS HIM WITH A BLIND STARE AS IF GUIDED ONLY BY THE SOUND. HE GAVE THE DISCUSSION UP WITH A SLIGHT SHRUG OF THE SHOULDERS. STEVIE ACCUSTOMED TO MOVE ABOUT DISREGARDED HAD GOT UP FROM THE KITCHEN TABLE CARRYING OFF HIS DRAWING TO BED WITH HIM. HE HAD REACHED THE PARLOUR DOOR IN TIME TO RECEIVE IN FULL THE SHOCK OF KARL YUNDT'S ELOQUENT IMAGERY. THE SHEET OF PAPER COVERED WITH CIRCLES DROPPED OUT OF HIS FINGERS AND HE REMAINED STARING AT THE OLD TERRORIST AS IF ROOTED SUDDENLY TO THE SPOT BY HIS MORBID HORROR AND DREAD OF PHYSICAL PAIN. STEVIE KNEW VERY WELL THAT HOT IRON APPLIED TO ONE'S SKIN HURT VERY MUCH. HIS SCARED EYES BLAZED WITH INDIGNATION IT WOULD HURT TERRIBLY HIS MOUTH DROPPED OPEN. MICHAELIS BY STARING UNWINKINGLY AT THE FIRE HAD REGAINED THAT SENTIMENT OF ISOLATION NECESSARY FOR THE CONTINUITY OF HIS THOUGHT. HIS OPTIMISM HAD BEGUN TO FLOW FROM HIS LIPS. IN THE DOORWAY STEVIE CALMED SEEMED SUNK IN HEBETUDE. COMRADE OSSIPON'S FACE TWITCHED WITH EXASPERATION. THEN IT'S NO USE DOING ANYTHING NO USE WHATEVER. I DON'T SAY THAT PROTESTED MICHAELIS GENTLY. HIS VISION OF TRUTH HAD GROWN SO INTENSE THAT THE SOUND OF A STRANGE VOICE FAILED TO ROUT IT THIS TIME. HE CONTINUED TO LOOK DOWN AT THE RED COALS. BUT HE ARGUED THAT REVOLUTIONARY PROPAGANDA WAS A DELICATE WORK OF HIGH CONSCIENCE. HE WOULD HAVE IT ADVANCE ITS TENETS CAUTIOUSLY EVEN TIMIDLY IN OUR IGNORANCE OF THE EFFECT THAT MAY BE PRODUCED BY ANY GIVEN ECONOMIC CHANGE UPON THE HAPPINESS THE MORALS THE INTELLECT THE HISTORY OF MANKIND. FOR HISTORY IS MADE WITH TOOLS NOT WITH IDEAS AND EVERYTHING IS CHANGED BY ECONOMIC CONDITIONS ART PHILOSOPHY LOVE VIRTUE TRUTH ITSELF. THE COALS IN THE GRATE SETTLED DOWN WITH A SLIGHT CRASH AND MICHAELIS THE HERMIT OF VISIONS IN THE DESERT OF A PENITENTIARY GOT UP IMPETUOUSLY. ROUND LIKE A DISTENDED BALLOON HE OPENED HIS SHORT THICK ARMS AS IF IN A PATHETICALLY HOPELESS ATTEMPT TO EMBRACE AND HUG TO HIS BREAST A SELF REGENERATED UNIVERSE HE GASPED WITH ARDOUR. THE FUTURE IS AS CERTAIN AS THE PAST SLAVERY FEUDALISM INDIVIDUALISM COLLECTIVISM. THIS IS THE STATEMENT OF A LAW NOT AN EMPTY PROPHECY. THE DISDAINFUL POUT OF COMRADE OSSIPON'S THICK LIPS ACCENTUATED THE NEGRO TYPE OF HIS FACE. NONSENSE HE SAID CALMLY ENOUGH. THERE IS NO LAW AND NO CERTAINTY THE TEACHING PROPAGANDA BE HANGED. WHAT THE PEOPLE KNOWS DOES NOT MATTER WERE ITS KNOWLEDGE EVER SO ACCURATE. HE PAUSED THEN ADDED WITH MODEST FIRMNESS. NOTHING GROWLED FROM THE SOFA MISTER VERLOC WHO PROVOKED BY THE ABHORRENT SOUND HAD MERELY MUTTERED A DAMN. THE VENOMOUS SPLUTTERING OF THE OLD TERRORIST WITHOUT TEETH WAS HEARD
