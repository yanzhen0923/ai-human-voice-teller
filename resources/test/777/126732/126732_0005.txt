MISTER VERLOC IN THE SAME POSITION CLEARED HIS THROAT AS IF FOR AN IMPORTANT STATEMENT BUT MERELY INQUIRED. DID YOU TURN OFF THE GAS DOWNSTAIRS. YES I DID ANSWERED MISSUS VERLOC CONSCIENTIOUSLY. THAT POOR BOY IS IN A VERY EXCITED STATE TO NIGHT SHE MURMURED AFTER A PAUSE WHICH LASTED FOR THREE TICKS OF THE CLOCK. MISTER VERLOC CARED NOTHING FOR STEVIE'S EXCITEMENT BUT HE FELT HORRIBLY WAKEFUL AND DREADED FACING THE DARKNESS AND SILENCE THAT WOULD FOLLOW THE EXTINGUISHING OF THE LAMP. THIS DREAD LED HIM TO MAKE THE REMARK THAT STEVIE HAD DISREGARDED HIS SUGGESTION TO GO TO BED. MISSUS VERLOC FALLING INTO THE TRAP STARTED TO DEMONSTRATE AT LENGTH TO HER HUSBAND THAT THIS WAS NOT IMPUDENCE OF ANY SORT BUT SIMPLY EXCITEMENT. THERE WAS NO YOUNG MAN OF HIS AGE IN LONDON MORE WILLING AND DOCILE THAN STEPHEN SHE AFFIRMED NONE MORE AFFECTIONATE AND READY TO PLEASE AND EVEN USEFUL AS LONG AS PEOPLE DID NOT UPSET HIS POOR HEAD. THAT ARDOUR OF PROTECTING COMPASSION EXALTED MORBIDLY IN HER CHILDHOOD BY THE MISERY OF ANOTHER CHILD TINGED HER SALLOW CHEEKS WITH A FAINT DUSKY BLUSH MADE HER BIG EYES GLEAM UNDER THE DARK LIDS. MISSUS VERLOC THEN LOOKED YOUNGER SHE LOOKED AS YOUNG AS WINNIE USED TO LOOK AND MUCH MORE ANIMATED THAN THE WINNIE OF THE BELGRAVIAN MANSION DAYS HAD EVER ALLOWED HERSELF TO APPEAR TO GENTLEMEN LODGERS. MISTER VERLOC'S ANXIETIES HAD PREVENTED HIM FROM ATTACHING ANY SENSE TO WHAT HIS WIFE WAS SAYING. IT WAS HER ASPECT THAT RECALLED HIM TO HIMSELF. WHEN HER VOICE CEASED HE MOVED UNEASILY AND SAID. I HAVEN'T BEEN FEELING WELL FOR THE LAST FEW DAYS. THAT BOY HEARS TOO MUCH OF WHAT IS TALKED ABOUT HERE. IF I HAD KNOWN THEY WERE COMING TO NIGHT I WOULD HAVE SEEN TO IT THAT HE WENT TO BED AT THE SAME TIME I DID. HE WAS OUT OF HIS MIND WITH SOMETHING HE OVERHEARD ABOUT EATING PEOPLE'S FLESH AND DRINKING BLOOD WHAT'S THE GOOD OF TALKING LIKE THAT. THERE WAS A NOTE OF INDIGNANT SCORN IN HER VOICE. MISTER VERLOC WAS FULLY RESPONSIVE NOW. ASK KARL YUNDT HE GROWLED SAVAGELY. MISSUS VERLOC WITH GREAT DECISION PRONOUNCED KARL YUNDT A DISGUSTING OLD MAN. SHE DECLARED OPENLY HER AFFECTION FOR MICHAELIS. HE ISN'T FIT TO HEAR WHAT'S SAID HERE HE BELIEVES IT'S ALL TRUE. HE KNOWS NO BETTER HE GETS INTO HIS PASSIONS OVER IT. MISTER VERLOC MADE NO COMMENT. HE GLARED AT ME AS IF HE DIDN'T KNOW WHO I WAS WHEN I WENT DOWNSTAIRS. HIS HEART WAS GOING LIKE A HAMMER HE CAN'T HELP BEING EXCITABLE. IT ISN'T HIS FAULT HE'S NO TROUBLE WHEN HE'S LEFT ALONE. MISTER VERLOC MADE NO COMMENT. I WISH HE HAD NEVER BEEN TO SCHOOL MISSUS VERLOC BEGAN AGAIN BRUSQUELY. HE GETS A RED FACE PORING OVER THEM. WE DON'T GET RID OF A DOZEN NUMBERS IN A MONTH. THEY ONLY TAKE UP ROOM IN THE FRONT WINDOW. I WOULDN'T GIVE A HALFPENNY FOR THE WHOLE LOT. IT'S SILLY READING THAT'S WHAT IT IS THERE'S NO SALE FOR IT. THE OTHER DAY STEVIE GOT HOLD OF ONE AND THERE WAS A STORY IN IT OF A GERMAN SOLDIER OFFICER TEARING HALF OFF THE EAR OF A RECRUIT AND NOTHING WAS DONE TO HIM FOR IT THE BRUTE. WE AREN'T GERMAN SLAVES HERE THANK GOD IT'S NOT OUR BUSINESS IS IT. MISTER VERLOC MADE NO REPLY. HE WAS SHOUTING AND STAMPING AND SOBBING. HE CAN'T STAND THE NOTION OF ANY CRUELTY. HE WOULD HAVE STUCK THAT OFFICER LIKE A PIG IF HE HAD SEEN HIM THEN IT'S TRUE TOO. SOME PEOPLE DON'T DESERVE MUCH MERCY. MISSUS VERLOC'S VOICE CEASED AND THE EXPRESSION OF HER MOTIONLESS EYES BECAME MORE AND MORE CONTEMPLATIVE AND VEILED DURING THE LONG PAUSE. COMFORTABLE DEAR. SHALL I PUT OUT THE LIGHT NOW. THE DREARY CONVICTION THAT THERE WAS NO SLEEP FOR HIM HELD MISTER VERLOC MUTE AND HOPELESSLY INERT IN HIS FEAR OF DARKNESS HE MADE A GREAT EFFORT
