AH HE DID NOT DEPEND UPON EMOTIONAL EXCITEMENT TO KEEP UP HIS BELIEF NO DECLAMATIONS NO ANGER NO VISIONS OF BLOOD RED FLAGS WAVING OR METAPHORICAL LURID SUNS OF VENGEANCE RISING ABOVE THE HORIZON OF A DOOMED SOCIETY NOT HE. COLD REASON HE BOASTED WAS THE BASIS OF HIS OPTIMISM YES OPTIMISM. DON'T YOU THINK THAT IF I HAD NOT BEEN THE OPTIMIST I AM I COULD NOT HAVE FOUND IN FIFTEEN YEARS SOME MEANS TO CUT MY THROAT. MICHAELIS PURSUED HIS IDEA THE IDEA OF HIS SOLITARY RECLUSION THE THOUGHT VOUCHSAFED TO HIS CAPTIVITY AND GROWING LIKE A FAITH REVEALED IN VISIONS. HE WAS NO GOOD IN DISCUSSION NOT BECAUSE ANY AMOUNT OF ARGUMENT COULD SHAKE HIS FAITH BUT BECAUSE THE MERE FACT OF HEARING ANOTHER VOICE DISCONCERTED HIM PAINFULLY CONFUSING HIS THOUGHTS AT ONCE THESE THOUGHTS THAT FOR SO MANY YEARS IN A MENTAL SOLITUDE MORE BARREN THAN A WATERLESS DESERT NO LIVING VOICE HAD EVER COMBATTED COMMENTED OR APPROVED. A HARSH LAUGH FROM COMRADE OSSIPON CUT THE TIRADE DEAD SHORT IN A SUDDEN FALTERING OF THE TONGUE AND A BEWILDERED UNSTEADINESS OF THE APOSTLE'S MILDLY EXALTED EYES. HE CLOSED THEM SLOWLY FOR A MOMENT AS IF TO COLLECT HIS ROUTED THOUGHTS. A SILENCE FELL BUT WHAT WITH THE TWO GAS JETS OVER THE TABLE AND THE GLOWING GRATE THE LITTLE PARLOUR BEHIND MISTER VERLOC'S SHOP HAD BECOME FRIGHTFULLY HOT. THE ARTIST NEVER TURNED HIS HEAD AND IN ALL HIS SOUL'S APPLICATION TO THE TASK HIS BACK QUIVERED HIS THIN NECK SUNK INTO A DEEP HOLLOW AT THE BASE OF THE SKULL SEEMED READY TO SNAP. MISTER VERLOC AFTER A GRUNT OF DISAPPROVING SURPRISE RETURNED TO THE SOFA. ALEXANDER OSSIPON GOT UP TALL IN HIS THREADBARE BLUE SERGE SUIT UNDER THE LOW CEILING SHOOK OFF THE STIFFNESS OF LONG IMMOBILITY AND STROLLED AWAY INTO THE KITCHEN DOWN TWO STEPS TO LOOK OVER STEVIE'S SHOULDER. HE CAME BACK PRONOUNCING ORACULARLY VERY GOOD. VERY CHARACTERISTIC PERFECTLY TYPICAL. WHAT'S VERY GOOD GRUNTED INQUIRINGLY MISTER VERLOC SETTLED AGAIN IN THE CORNER OF THE SOFA. TYPICAL OF THIS FORM OF DEGENERACY THESE DRAWINGS I MEAN. YOU WOULD CALL THAT LAD A DEGENERATE WOULD YOU MUMBLED MISTER VERLOC. THAT'S WHAT HE MAY BE CALLED SCIENTIFICALLY. VERY GOOD TYPE TOO ALTOGETHER OF THAT SORT OF DEGENERATE. IT'S ENOUGH TO GLANCE AT THE LOBES OF HIS EARS IF YOU READ LOMBROSO. OF LATE EVEN THE MEREST DERIVATIVE OF THE WORD SCIENCE A TERM IN ITSELF INOFFENSIVE AND OF INDEFINITE MEANING HAD THE CURIOUS POWER OF EVOKING A DEFINITELY OFFENSIVE MENTAL VISION OF MISTER VLADIMIR IN HIS BODY AS HE LIVED WITH AN ALMOST SUPERNATURAL CLEARNESS. AND THIS PHENOMENON DESERVING JUSTLY TO BE CLASSED AMONGST THE MARVELS OF SCIENCE INDUCED IN MISTER VERLOC AN EMOTIONAL STATE OF DREAD AND EXASPERATION TENDING TO EXPRESS ITSELF IN VIOLENT SWEARING BUT HE SAID NOTHING. IT WAS KARL YUNDT WHO WAS HEARD IMPLACABLE TO HIS LAST BREATH. LOMBROSO IS AN ASS. COMRADE OSSIPON MET THE SHOCK OF THIS BLASPHEMY BY AN AWFUL VACANT STARE. AND THE OTHER HIS EXTINGUISHED EYES WITHOUT GLEAMS BLACKENING THE DEEP SHADOWS UNDER THE GREAT BONY FOREHEAD MUMBLED CATCHING THE TIP OF HIS TONGUE BETWEEN HIS LIPS AT EVERY SECOND WORD AS THOUGH HE WERE CHEWING IT ANGRILY. DID YOU EVER SEE SUCH AN IDIOT. FOR HIM THE CRIMINAL IS THE PRISONER SIMPLE IS IT NOT. WHAT ABOUT THOSE WHO SHUT HIM UP THERE FORCED HIM IN THERE. EXACTLY FORCED HIM IN THERE AND WHAT IS CRIME. DOES HE KNOW THAT THIS IMBECILE WHO HAS MADE HIS WAY IN THIS WORLD OF GORGED FOOLS BY LOOKING AT THE EARS AND TEETH OF A LOT OF POOR LUCKLESS DEVILS. TEETH AND EARS MARK THE CRIMINAL DO THEY. AND WHAT ABOUT THE LAW THAT MARKS HIM STILL BETTER THE PRETTY BRANDING INSTRUMENT INVENTED BY THE OVERFED TO PROTECT THEMSELVES AGAINST THE HUNGRY. RED HOT APPLICATIONS ON THEIR VILE SKINS HEY. CAN'T YOU SMELL AND HEAR FROM HERE THE THICK HIDE OF THE PEOPLE BURN AND SIZZLE. THERE WAS AN EXTRAORDINARY FORCE OF SUGGESTION IN THIS POSTURING
