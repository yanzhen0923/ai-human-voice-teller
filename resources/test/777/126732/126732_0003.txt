DO YOU KNOW HOW I WOULD CALL THE NATURE OF THE PRESENT ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. I WOULD CALL IT CANNIBALISTIC THAT'S WHAT IT IS. THEY ARE NOURISHING THEIR GREED ON THE QUIVERING FLESH AND THE WARM BLOOD OF THE PEOPLE NOTHING ELSE. STEVIE SWALLOWED THE TERRIFYING STATEMENT WITH AN AUDIBLE GULP AND AT ONCE AS THOUGH IT HAD BEEN SWIFT POISON SANK LIMPLY IN A SITTING POSTURE ON THE STEPS OF THE KITCHEN DOOR. MICHAELIS GAVE NO SIGN OF HAVING HEARD ANYTHING. HIS LIPS SEEMED GLUED TOGETHER FOR GOOD NOT A QUIVER PASSED OVER HIS HEAVY CHEEKS. WITH TROUBLED EYES HE LOOKED FOR HIS ROUND HARD HAT AND PUT IT ON HIS ROUND HEAD. HIS ROUND AND OBESE BODY SEEMED TO FLOAT LOW BETWEEN THE CHAIRS UNDER THE SHARP ELBOW OF KARL YUNDT. THE OLD TERRORIST RAISING AN UNCERTAIN AND CLAWLIKE HAND GAVE A SWAGGERING TILT TO A BLACK FELT SOMBRERO SHADING THE HOLLOWS AND RIDGES OF HIS WASTED FACE. HE GOT IN MOTION SLOWLY STRIKING THE FLOOR WITH HIS STICK AT EVERY STEP. MISTER VERLOC SAW HIS GUESTS OFF THE PREMISES ATTENDING THEM BAREHEADED HIS HEAVY OVERCOAT HANGING OPEN HIS EYES ON THE GROUND. HE CLOSED THE DOOR BEHIND THEIR BACKS WITH RESTRAINED VIOLENCE TURNED THE KEY SHOT THE BOLT. HE WAS NOT SATISFIED WITH HIS FRIENDS. IN THE LIGHT OF MISTER VLADIMIR'S PHILOSOPHY OF BOMB THROWING THEY APPEARED HOPELESSLY FUTILE. THE PART OF MISTER VERLOC IN REVOLUTIONARY POLITICS HAVING BEEN TO OBSERVE HE COULD NOT ALL AT ONCE EITHER IN HIS OWN HOME OR IN LARGER ASSEMBLIES TAKE THE INITIATIVE OF ACTION HE HAD TO BE CAUTIOUS. PAUSING IN HIS INTENTION TO TURN OFF THE GAS BURNING IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SHOP MISTER VERLOC DESCENDED INTO THE ABYSS OF MORAL REFLECTIONS. WITH THE INSIGHT OF A KINDRED TEMPERAMENT HE PRONOUNCED HIS VERDICT. A LAZY LOT THIS KARL YUNDT NURSED BY A BLEAR EYED OLD WOMAN A WOMAN HE HAD YEARS AGO ENTICED AWAY FROM A FRIEND AND AFTERWARDS HAD TRIED MORE THAN ONCE TO SHAKE OFF INTO THE GUTTER. JOLLY LUCKY FOR YUNDT THAT SHE HAD PERSISTED IN COMING UP TIME AFTER TIME OR ELSE THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN NO ONE NOW TO HELP HIM OUT OF THE BUS BY THE GREEN PARK RAILINGS WHERE THAT SPECTRE TOOK ITS CONSTITUTIONAL CRAWL EVERY FINE MORNING. AND MISTER VERLOC'S MORALITY WAS OFFENDED ALSO BY THE OPTIMISM OF MICHAELIS ANNEXED BY HIS WEALTHY OLD LADY WHO HAD TAKEN LATELY TO SENDING HIM TO A COTTAGE SHE HAD IN THE COUNTRY. THE EX PRISONER COULD MOON ABOUT THE SHADY LANES FOR DAYS TOGETHER IN A DELICIOUS AND HUMANITARIAN IDLENESS. AS TO OSSIPON THAT BEGGAR WAS SURE TO WANT FOR NOTHING AS LONG AS THERE WERE SILLY GIRLS WITH SAVINGS BANK BOOKS IN THE WORLD. THERE ARE NATURES TOO TO WHOSE SENSE OF JUSTICE THE PRICE EXACTED LOOMS UP MONSTROUSLY ENORMOUS ODIOUS OPPRESSIVE WORRYING HUMILIATING EXTORTIONATE INTOLERABLE THOSE ARE THE FANATICS. THE REMAINING PORTION OF SOCIAL REBELS IS ACCOUNTED FOR BY VANITY THE MOTHER OF ALL NOBLE AND VILE ILLUSIONS THE COMPANION OF POETS REFORMERS CHARLATANS PROPHETS AND INCENDIARIES. LOST FOR A WHOLE MINUTE IN THE ABYSS OF MEDITATION MISTER VERLOC DID NOT REACH THE DEPTH OF THESE ABSTRACT CONSIDERATIONS PERHAPS HE WAS NOT ABLE. IN ANY CASE HE HAD NOT THE TIME. A SHADE OF ENVY CREPT INTO HIS THOUGHTS. LOAFING WAS ALL VERY WELL FOR THESE FELLOWS WHO KNEW NOT MISTER VLADIMIR AND HAD WOMEN TO FALL BACK UPON WHEREAS HE HAD A WOMAN TO PROVIDE FOR. THEN WHY NOT GO NOW AT ONCE HE SIGHED. THE NECESSITY WAS NOT SO NORMALLY PLEASURABLE AS IT OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN FOR A MAN OF HIS AGE AND TEMPERAMENT. HE DREADED THE DEMON OF SLEEPLESSNESS WHICH HE FELT HAD MARKED HIM FOR ITS OWN. HE RAISED HIS ARM AND TURNED OFF THE FLARING GAS JET ABOVE HIS HEAD. A BRIGHT BAND OF LIGHT FELL THROUGH THE PARLOUR DOOR INTO THE PART OF THE SHOP BEHIND THE COUNTER. IT ENABLED MISTER VERLOC TO ASCERTAIN AT A GLANCE THE NUMBER OF SILVER COINS IN THE TILL. THESE WERE BUT FEW AND FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE HE OPENED HIS SHOP HE TOOK A COMMERCIAL SURVEY OF ITS VALUE. THIS SURVEY WAS UNFAVOURABLE. HE HAD GONE INTO TRADE FOR NO COMMERCIAL REASONS. MOREOVER IT DID NOT TAKE HIM OUT OF HIS OWN SPHERE THE SPHERE WHICH IS WATCHED BY THE POLICE
