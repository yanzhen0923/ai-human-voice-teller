AT THAT WORD DECEPTION SPOKEN WITH SUCH SELF CONTEMPT THE COLOR FLASHED BACK INTO HILDA'S FACE AS SUDDENLY AS IF SHE HAD BEEN STRUCK BY A WHIPLASH. SHE BIT HER LIP AND LOOKED DOWN AT HER HANDS WHICH WERE CLASPED TIGHTLY IN FRONT OF HER. COULD YOU COULD YOU SIT DOWN AND TALK ABOUT IT QUIETLY BARTLEY AS IF I WERE A FRIEND AND NOT SOME ONE WHO HAD TO BE DEFIED. HE DROPPED BACK HEAVILY INTO HIS CHAIR BY THE FIRE. IT WAS MYSELF I WAS DEFYING HILDA. I HAVE THOUGHT ABOUT IT UNTIL I AM WORN OUT. HE LOOKED AT HER AND HIS HAGGARD FACE SOFTENED. HE PUT OUT HIS HAND TOWARD HER AS HE LOOKED AWAY AGAIN INTO THE FIRE. SHE CREPT ACROSS TO HIM DRAWING HER STOOL AFTER HER. WHEN DID YOU FIRST BEGIN TO FEEL LIKE THIS BARTLEY. AFTER THE VERY FIRST. THE FIRST WAS SORT OF IN PLAY WASN'T IT. HILDA'S FACE QUIVERED BUT SHE WHISPERED YES I THINK IT MUST HAVE BEEN. BUT WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME WHEN YOU WERE HERE IN THE SUMMER. ALEXANDER GROANED. I MEANT TO BUT SOMEHOW I COULDN'T. WE HAD ONLY A FEW DAYS AND YOUR NEW PLAY WAS JUST ON AND YOU WERE SO HAPPY. YES I WAS HAPPY WASN'T I. SHE PRESSED HIS HAND GENTLY IN GRATITUDE WEREN'T YOU HAPPY THEN AT ALL. SHE CLOSED HER EYES AND TOOK A DEEP BREATH AS IF TO DRAW IN AGAIN THE FRAGRANCE OF THOSE DAYS. SOMETHING OF THEIR TROUBLING SWEETNESS CAME BACK TO ALEXANDER TOO. HE MOVED UNEASILY AND HIS CHAIR CREAKED. YES I WAS THEN YOU KNOW BUT AFTERWARD. YES YES SHE HURRIED PULLING HER HAND GENTLY AWAY FROM HIM. PRESENTLY IT STOLE BACK TO HIS COAT SLEEVE. PLEASE TELL ME ONE THING BARTLEY. AT LEAST TELL ME THAT YOU BELIEVE I THOUGHT I WAS MAKING YOU HAPPY. HIS HAND SHUT DOWN QUICKLY OVER THE QUESTIONING FINGERS ON HIS SLEEVES. YES HILDA I KNOW THAT HE SAID SIMPLY. SHE LEANED HER HEAD AGAINST HIS ARM AND SPOKE SOFTLY. YOU SEE MY MISTAKE WAS IN WANTING YOU TO HAVE EVERYTHING. I WANTED YOU TO EAT ALL THE CAKES AND HAVE THEM TOO. I SOMEHOW BELIEVED THAT I COULD TAKE ALL THE BAD CONSEQUENCES FOR YOU. I WANTED YOU ALWAYS TO BE HAPPY AND HANDSOME AND SUCCESSFUL TO HAVE ALL THE THINGS THAT A GREAT MAN OUGHT TO HAVE AND ONCE IN A WAY THE CARELESS HOLIDAYS THAT GREAT MEN ARE NOT PERMITTED. BARTLEY GAVE A BITTER LITTLE LAUGH AND HILDA LOOKED UP AND READ IN THE DEEPENING LINES OF HIS FACE THAT YOUTH AND BARTLEY WOULD NOT MUCH LONGER STRUGGLE TOGETHER. I UNDERSTAND BARTLEY I WAS WRONG. BUT I DIDN'T KNOW YOU'VE ONLY TO TELL ME NOW. WHAT MUST I DO THAT I'VE NOT DONE OR WHAT MUST I NOT DO. SHE LISTENED INTENTLY BUT SHE HEARD NOTHING BUT THE CREAKING OF HIS CHAIR. YOU WANT ME TO SAY IT SHE WHISPERED. YOU WANT TO TELL ME THAT YOU CAN ONLY SEE ME LIKE THIS AS OLD FRIENDS DO OR OUT IN THE WORLD AMONG PEOPLE I CAN DO THAT. I CAN'T HE SAID HEAVILY. HILDA SHIVERED AND SAT STILL. BARTLEY LEANED HIS HEAD IN HIS HANDS AND SPOKE THROUGH HIS TEETH. IT'S GOT TO BE A CLEAN BREAK HILDA. I CAN'T SEE YOU AT ALL ANYWHERE. WHAT I MEAN IS THAT I WANT YOU TO PROMISE NEVER TO SEE ME AGAIN NO MATTER HOW OFTEN I COME NO MATTER HOW HARD I BEG. HILDA SPRANG UP LIKE A FLAME. SHE STOOD OVER HIM WITH HER HANDS CLENCHED AT HER SIDE HER BODY RIGID. NO SHE GASPED. IT'S TOO LATE TO ASK THAT DO YOU HEAR ME BARTLEY. IT'S TOO LATE I WON'T PROMISE. IT'S ABOMINABLE OF YOU TO ASK ME. BUT IF YOU COME TO ME I'LL DO AS I SEE FIT. THE SHAMEFULNESS OF YOUR ASKING ME TO DO THAT. ALEXANDER ROSE AND SHOOK HIMSELF ANGRILY. YES I KNOW I'M COWARDLY. I'M AFRAID OF MYSELF I DON'T TRUST MYSELF ANY MORE
