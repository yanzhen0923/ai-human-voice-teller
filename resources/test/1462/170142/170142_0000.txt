THE LAST TWO DAYS OF THE VOYAGE BARTLEY FOUND ALMOST INTOLERABLE. THE STOP AT QUEENSTOWN THE TEDIOUS PASSAGE UP THE MERSEY WERE THINGS THAT HE NOTED DIMLY THROUGH HIS GROWING IMPATIENCE. HE HAD PLANNED TO STOP IN LIVERPOOL BUT INSTEAD HE TOOK THE BOAT TRAIN FOR LONDON. EMERGING AT EUSTON AT HALF PAST THREE O'CLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON ALEXANDER HAD HIS LUGGAGE SENT TO THE SAVOY AND DROVE AT ONCE TO BEDFORD SQUARE. WHEN MARIE MET HIM AT THE DOOR EVEN HER STRONG SENSE OF THE PROPRIETIES COULD NOT RESTRAIN HER SURPRISE AND DELIGHT. SHE BLUSHED AND SMILED AND FUMBLED HIS CARD IN HER CONFUSION BEFORE SHE RAN UPSTAIRS. ALEXANDER PACED UP AND DOWN THE HALLWAY BUTTONING AND UNBUTTONING HIS OVERCOAT UNTIL SHE RETURNED AND TOOK HIM UP TO HILDA'S LIVING ROOM. THE ROOM WAS EMPTY WHEN HE ENTERED. A COAL FIRE WAS CRACKLING IN THE GRATE AND THE LAMPS WERE LIT FOR IT WAS ALREADY BEGINNING TO GROW DARK OUTSIDE. ALEXANDER DID NOT SIT DOWN. HE STOOD HIS GROUND OVER BY THE WINDOWS UNTIL HILDA CAME IN. SHE CALLED HIS NAME ON THE THRESHOLD BUT IN HER SWIFT FLIGHT ACROSS THE ROOM SHE FELT A CHANGE IN HIM AND CAUGHT HERSELF UP SO DEFTLY THAT HE COULD NOT TELL JUST WHEN SHE DID IT. SHE MERELY BRUSHED HIS CHEEK WITH HER LIPS AND PUT A HAND LIGHTLY AND JOYOUSLY ON EITHER SHOULDER. OH WHAT A GRAND THING TO HAPPEN ON A RAW DAY. I FELT IT IN MY BONES WHEN I WOKE THIS MORNING THAT SOMETHING SPLENDID WAS GOING TO TURN UP. I THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE SISTER KATE OR COUSIN MIKE WOULD BE HAPPENING ALONG. I NEVER DREAMED IT WOULD BE YOU BARTLEY. BUT WHY DO YOU LET ME CHATTER ON LIKE THIS. COME OVER TO THE FIRE YOU'RE CHILLED THROUGH. WHEN DID YOU COME BARTLEY AND HOW DID IT HAPPEN YOU HAVEN'T SPOKEN A WORD. I GOT IN ABOUT TEN MINUTES AGO. I LANDED AT LIVERPOOL THIS MORNING AND CAME DOWN ON THE BOAT TRAIN. ALEXANDER LEANED FORWARD AND WARMED HIS HANDS BEFORE THE BLAZE. HILDA WATCHED HIM WITH PERPLEXITY. THERE'S SOMETHING TROUBLING YOU BARTLEY WHAT IS IT. BARTLEY BENT LOWER OVER THE FIRE. IT'S THE WHOLE THING THAT TROUBLES ME HILDA YOU AND I. HILDA TOOK A QUICK SOFT BREATH. SHE LOOKED AT HIS HEAVY SHOULDERS AND BIG DETERMINED HEAD THRUST FORWARD LIKE A CATAPULT IN LEASH. WHAT ABOUT US BARTLEY. SHE ASKED IN A THIN VOICE. HE LOCKED AND UNLOCKED HIS HANDS OVER THE GRATE AND SPREAD HIS FINGERS CLOSE TO THE BLUISH FLAME WHILE THE COALS CRACKLED AND THE CLOCK TICKED AND A STREET VENDOR BEGAN TO CALL UNDER THE WINDOW. AT LAST ALEXANDER BROUGHT OUT ONE WORD EVERYTHING. HILDA WAS PALE BY THIS TIME AND HER EYES WERE WIDE WITH FRIGHT. SHE LOOKED ABOUT DESPERATELY FROM BARTLEY TO THE DOOR THEN TO THE WINDOWS AND BACK AGAIN TO BARTLEY. I'LL DO ANYTHING YOU WISH ME TO BARTLEY SHE SAID TREMULOUSLY. I CAN'T STAND SEEING YOU MISERABLE. I CAN'T LIVE WITH MYSELF ANY LONGER HE ANSWERED ROUGHLY. HE ROSE AND PUSHED THE CHAIR BEHIND HIM AND BEGAN TO WALK MISERABLY ABOUT THE ROOM SEEMING TO FIND IT TOO SMALL FOR HIM. HE PULLED UP A WINDOW AS IF THE AIR WERE HEAVY. HILDA WATCHED HIM FROM HER CORNER TREMBLING AND SCARCELY BREATHING DARK SHADOWS GROWING ABOUT HER EYES. IT IT HASN'T ALWAYS MADE YOU MISERABLE HAS IT. HER EYELIDS FELL AND HER LIPS QUIVERED. ALWAYS BUT IT'S WORSE NOW. IT'S UNBEARABLE IT TORTURES ME EVERY MINUTE. BUT WHY NOW SHE ASKED PITEOUSLY WRINGING HER HANDS. HE IGNORED HER QUESTION. I AM NOT A MAN WHO CAN LIVE TWO LIVES HE WENT ON FEVERISHLY EACH LIFE SPOILS THE OTHER. I GET NOTHING BUT MISERY OUT OF EITHER. THE WORLD IS ALL THERE JUST AS IT USED TO BE BUT I CAN'T GET AT IT ANY MORE. THERE IS THIS DECEPTION BETWEEN ME AND EVERYTHING
