I CARRIED IT ALL LIGHTLY ENOUGH AT FIRST BUT NOW I DON'T DARE TRIFLE WITH IT IT'S GETTING THE BETTER OF ME. IT'S DIFFERENT NOW I'M GROWING OLDER AND YOU'VE GOT MY YOUNG SELF HERE WITH YOU. IT'S THROUGH HIM THAT I'VE COME TO WISH FOR YOU ALL AND ALL THE TIME. HE TOOK HER ROUGHLY IN HIS ARMS DO YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN. HILDA HELD HER FACE BACK FROM HIM AND BEGAN TO CRY BITTERLY. OH BARTLEY WHAT AM I TO DO. YOU ASK ME TO STAY AWAY FROM YOU BECAUSE YOU WANT ME. AND I'VE GOT NOBODY BUT YOU. I WILL DO ANYTHING YOU SAY BUT THAT. I WILL ASK THE LEAST IMAGINABLE BUT I MUST HAVE SOMETHING. BARTLEY TURNED AWAY AND SANK DOWN IN HIS CHAIR AGAIN. HILDA SAT ON THE ARM OF IT AND PUT HER HANDS LIGHTLY ON HIS SHOULDERS. JUST SOMETHING BARTLEY. I MUST HAVE YOU TO THINK OF THROUGH THE MONTHS AND MONTHS OF LONELINESS. I MUST SEE YOU I MUST KNOW ABOUT YOU. THE SIGHT OF YOU BARTLEY TO SEE YOU LIVING AND HAPPY AND SUCCESSFUL CAN I NEVER MAKE YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT THAT MEANS TO ME. SHE PRESSED HIS SHOULDERS GENTLY. YOU SEE LOVING SOME ONE AS I LOVE YOU MAKES THE WHOLE WORLD DIFFERENT. IF I'D MET YOU LATER IF I HADN'T LOVED YOU SO WELL BUT THAT'S ALL OVER LONG AGO. THEN CAME ALL THOSE YEARS WITHOUT YOU LONELY AND HURT AND DISCOURAGED THOSE DECENT YOUNG FELLOWS AND POOR MAC AND ME NEVER HEEDING HARD AS A STEEL SPRING. AND THEN YOU CAME BACK NOT CARING VERY MUCH BUT IT MADE NO DIFFERENCE. SHE SLID TO THE FLOOR BESIDE HIM AS IF SHE WERE TOO TIRED TO SIT UP ANY LONGER. BARTLEY BENT OVER AND TOOK HER IN HIS ARMS KISSING HER MOUTH AND HER WET TIRED EYES. DON'T CRY DON'T CRY HE WHISPERED. WE'VE TORTURED EACH OTHER ENOUGH FOR TONIGHT. FORGET EVERYTHING EXCEPT THAT I AM HERE
