ON THE LAST SATURDAY IN APRIL THE NEW YORK TIMES PUBLISHED AN ACCOUNT OF THE STRIKE COMPLICATIONS WHICH WERE DELAYING ALEXANDER'S NEW JERSEY BRIDGE AND STATED THAT THE ENGINEER HIMSELF WAS IN TOWN AND AT HIS OFFICE ON WEST TENTH STREET. ON SUNDAY THE DAY AFTER THIS NOTICE APPEARED ALEXANDER WORKED ALL DAY AT HIS TENTH STREET ROOMS. HIS BUSINESS OFTEN CALLED HIM TO NEW YORK AND HE HAD KEPT AN APARTMENT THERE FOR YEARS SUBLETTING IT WHEN HE WENT ABROAD FOR ANY LENGTH OF TIME. BESIDES HIS SLEEPING ROOM AND BATH THERE WAS A LARGE ROOM FORMERLY A PAINTER'S STUDIO WHICH HE USED AS A STUDY AND OFFICE. IT WAS FURNISHED WITH THE CAST OFF POSSESSIONS OF HIS BACHELOR DAYS AND WITH ODD THINGS WHICH HE SHELTERED FOR FRIENDS OF HIS WHO FOLLOWED ITINERANT AND MORE OR LESS ARTISTIC CALLINGS. OVER THE FIREPLACE THERE WAS A LARGE OLD FASHIONED GILT MIRROR. ALEXANDER'S BIG WORK TABLE STOOD IN FRONT OF ONE OF THE THREE WINDOWS AND ABOVE THE COUCH HUNG THE ONE PICTURE IN THE ROOM A BIG CANVAS OF CHARMING COLOR AND SPIRIT A STUDY OF THE LUXEMBOURG GARDENS IN EARLY SPRING PAINTED IN HIS YOUTH BY A MAN WHO HAD SINCE BECOME A PORTRAIT PAINTER OF INTERNATIONAL RENOWN. HE HAD DONE IT FOR ALEXANDER WHEN THEY WERE STUDENTS TOGETHER IN PARIS. SUNDAY WAS A COLD RAW DAY AND A FINE RAIN FELL CONTINUOUSLY. WHEN ALEXANDER CAME BACK FROM DINNER HE PUT MORE WOOD ON HIS FIRE MADE HIMSELF COMFORTABLE AND SETTLED DOWN AT HIS DESK WHERE HE BEGAN CHECKING OVER ESTIMATE SHEETS. IT WAS AFTER NINE O'CLOCK AND HE WAS LIGHTING A SECOND PIPE WHEN HE THOUGHT HE HEARD A SOUND AT HIS DOOR. HE STARTED AND LISTENED HOLDING THE BURNING MATCH IN HIS HAND AGAIN HE HEARD THE SAME SOUND LIKE A FIRM LIGHT TAP. HE ROSE AND CROSSED THE ROOM QUICKLY. WHEN HE THREW OPEN THE DOOR HE RECOGNIZED THE FIGURE THAT SHRANK BACK INTO THE BARE DIMLY LIT HALLWAY. HE STOOD FOR A MOMENT IN AWKWARD CONSTRAINT HIS PIPE IN HIS HAND. COME IN HE SAID TO HILDA AT LAST AND CLOSED THE DOOR BEHIND HER. HE POINTED TO A CHAIR BY THE FIRE AND WENT BACK TO HIS WORKTABLE WON'T YOU SIT DOWN. HE WAS STANDING BEHIND THE TABLE TURNING OVER A PILE OF BLUEPRINTS NERVOUSLY. THE YELLOW LIGHT FROM THE STUDENT'S LAMP FELL ON HIS HANDS AND THE PURPLE SLEEVES OF HIS VELVET SMOKING JACKET BUT HIS FLUSHED FACE AND BIG HARD HEAD WERE IN THE SHADOW. THERE WAS SOMETHING ABOUT HIM THAT MADE HILDA WISH HERSELF AT HER HOTEL AGAIN IN THE STREET BELOW ANYWHERE BUT WHERE SHE WAS. OF COURSE I KNOW BARTLEY SHE SAID AT LAST THAT AFTER THIS YOU WON'T OWE ME THE LEAST CONSIDERATION BUT WE SAIL ON TUESDAY. I SAW THAT INTERVIEW IN THE PAPER YESTERDAY TELLING WHERE YOU WERE AND I THOUGHT I HAD TO SEE YOU THAT'S ALL GOOD NIGHT I'M GOING NOW. SHE TURNED AND HER HAND CLOSED ON THE DOOR KNOB. ALEXANDER HURRIED TOWARD HER AND TOOK HER GENTLY BY THE ARM. SIT DOWN HILDA YOU'RE WET THROUGH. LET ME TAKE OFF YOUR COAT AND YOUR BOOTS THEY'RE OOZING WATER. HE KNELT DOWN AND BEGAN TO UNLACE HER SHOES WHILE HILDA SHRANK INTO THE CHAIR. HERE PUT YOUR FEET ON THIS STOOL. YOU DON'T MEAN TO SAY YOU WALKED DOWN AND WITHOUT OVERSHOES. HILDA HID HER FACE IN HER HANDS. I WAS AFRAID TO TAKE A CAB. CAN'T YOU SEE BARTLEY THAT I'M TERRIBLY FRIGHTENED. I'VE BEEN THROUGH THIS A HUNDRED TIMES TO DAY. DON'T BE ANY MORE ANGRY THAN YOU CAN HELP. I WAS ALL RIGHT UNTIL I KNEW YOU WERE IN TOWN. IF YOU'D SENT ME A NOTE OR TELEPHONED ME OR ANYTHING. BUT YOU WON'T LET ME WRITE TO YOU AND I HAD TO SEE YOU AFTER THAT LETTER THAT TERRIBLE LETTER YOU WROTE ME WHEN YOU GOT HOME. IS THIS THE WAY YOU MEAN TO ANSWER IT HILDA HE ASKED UNSTEADILY. I CAME TO TELL YOU THAT I'M WILLING TO DO AS YOU ASKED ME
