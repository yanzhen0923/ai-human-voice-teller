BUT IT'S NO USE TALKING ABOUT THAT NOW GIVE ME MY THINGS PLEASE. SHE PUT HER HAND OUT TOWARD THE FENDER. ALEXANDER SAT DOWN ON THE ARM OF HER CHAIR. DID YOU THINK I HAD FORGOTTEN YOU WERE IN TOWN HILDA. DO YOU THINK I KEPT AWAY BY ACCIDENT. THERE IS A LETTER FOR YOU THERE IN MY DESK DRAWER. IT WAS TO HAVE REACHED YOU ON THE STEAMER. I WAS ALL THE MORNING WRITING IT. I TOLD MYSELF THAT IF I WERE REALLY THINKING OF YOU AND NOT OF MYSELF A LETTER WOULD BE BETTER THAN NOTHING. MARKS ON PAPER MEAN SOMETHING TO YOU. HE PAUSED THEY NEVER DID TO ME. HILDA SMILED UP AT HIM BEAUTIFULLY AND PUT HER HAND ON HIS SLEEVE. OH BARTLEY DID YOU WRITE TO ME. ALEXANDER SLIPPED HIS ARM ABOUT HER. I DIDN'T KNOW IT BEFORE HILDA ON MY HONOR I DIDN'T BUT I BELIEVE IT WAS BECAUSE DEEP DOWN IN ME SOMEWHERE I WAS HOPING I MIGHT DRIVE YOU TO DO JUST THIS. I'VE WATCHED THAT DOOR ALL DAY. I'VE JUMPED UP IF THE FIRE CRACKLED. I THINK I HAVE FELT THAT YOU WERE COMING. HE BENT HIS FACE OVER HER HAIR. AND I SHE WHISPERED I FELT THAT YOU WERE FEELING THAT. BUT WHEN I CAME I THOUGHT I HAD BEEN MISTAKEN. ALEXANDER STARTED UP AND BEGAN TO WALK UP AND DOWN THE ROOM. NO YOU WEREN'T MISTAKEN. I'VE BEEN UP IN CANADA WITH MY BRIDGE AND I ARRANGED NOT TO COME TO NEW YORK UNTIL AFTER YOU HAD GONE. THEN WHEN YOUR MANAGER ADDED TWO MORE WEEKS I WAS ALREADY COMMITTED. HE DROPPED UPON THE STOOL IN FRONT OF HER AND SAT WITH HIS HANDS HANGING BETWEEN HIS KNEES. WHAT AM I TO DO HILDA. THAT'S WHAT I WANTED TO SEE YOU ABOUT BARTLEY. I'M GOING TO DO WHAT YOU ASKED ME TO DO WHEN YOU WERE IN LONDON. ONLY I'LL DO IT MORE COMPLETELY. I'M GOING TO MARRY WHO. OH IT DOESN'T MATTER MUCH ONE OF THEM. ONLY NOT MAC I'M TOO FOND OF HIM. ALEXANDER MOVED RESTLESSLY. ARE YOU JOKING HILDA INDEED I'M NOT. THEN YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. YES I KNOW VERY WELL. I'VE THOUGHT ABOUT IT A GREAT DEAL AND I'VE QUITE DECIDED. I NEVER USED TO UNDERSTAND HOW WOMEN DID THINGS LIKE THAT BUT I KNOW NOW. IT'S BECAUSE THEY CAN'T BE AT THE MERCY OF THE MAN THEY LOVE ANY LONGER. ALEXANDER FLUSHED ANGRILY. SO IT'S BETTER TO BE AT THE MERCY OF A MAN YOU DON'T LOVE. UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES INFINITELY. HE GOT UP AND WENT OVER TO THE WINDOW THREW IT OPEN AND LEANED OUT. HE HEARD HILDA MOVING ABOUT BEHIND HIM. WHEN HE LOOKED OVER HIS SHOULDER SHE WAS LACING HER BOOTS. HE WENT BACK AND STOOD OVER HER. HILDA YOU'D BETTER THINK A WHILE LONGER BEFORE YOU DO THAT. I DON'T KNOW WHAT I OUGHT TO SAY BUT I DON'T BELIEVE YOU'D BE HAPPY TRULY I DON'T AREN'T YOU TRYING TO FRIGHTEN ME. SHE TIED THE KNOT OF THE LAST LACING AND PUT HER BOOT HEEL DOWN FIRMLY. NO I'M TELLING YOU WHAT I'VE MADE UP MY MIND TO DO. I SUPPOSE I WOULD BETTER DO IT WITHOUT TELLING YOU. BUT AFTERWARD I SHAN'T HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO EXPLAIN FOR I SHAN'T BE SEEING YOU AGAIN. ALEXANDER STARTED TO SPEAK BUT CAUGHT HIMSELF. WHEN HILDA ROSE HE SAT DOWN ON THE ARM OF HER CHAIR AND DREW HER BACK INTO IT. I WOULDN'T BE SO MUCH ALARMED IF I DIDN'T KNOW HOW UTTERLY RECKLESS YOU CAN BE. DON'T DO ANYTHING LIKE THAT RASHLY. HIS FACE GREW TROUBLED. YOU WOULDN'T BE HAPPY YOU ARE NOT THAT KIND OF WOMAN. I'D NEVER HAVE ANOTHER HOUR'S PEACE IF I HELPED TO MAKE YOU DO A THING LIKE THAT. HE TOOK HER FACE BETWEEN HIS HANDS AND LOOKED DOWN INTO IT. YOU SEE YOU ARE DIFFERENT HILDA DON'T YOU KNOW YOU ARE. HIS VOICE GREW SOFTER HIS TOUCH MORE AND MORE TENDER. HILDA HAD HEARD THAT SOFT DEEP TONE IN HIS VOICE ONLY ONCE BEFORE. SHE CLOSED HER EYES HER LIPS AND EYELIDS TREMBLED. ONLY ONE BARTLEY ONLY ONE
