ON THE NIGHT OF HIS ARRIVAL IN LONDON ALEXANDER WENT IMMEDIATELY TO THE HOTEL ON THE EMBANKMENT AT WHICH HE ALWAYS STOPPED AND IN THE LOBBY HE WAS ACCOSTED BY AN OLD ACQUAINTANCE MAURICE MAINHALL WHO FELL UPON HIM WITH EFFUSIVE CORDIALITY AND INDICATED A WILLINGNESS TO DINE WITH HIM. BARTLEY NEVER DINED ALONE IF HE COULD HELP IT AND MAINHALL WAS A GOOD GOSSIP WHO ALWAYS KNEW WHAT HAD BEEN GOING ON IN TOWN ESPECIALLY HE KNEW EVERYTHING THAT WAS NOT PRINTED IN THE NEWSPAPERS. THE NEPHEW OF ONE OF THE STANDARD VICTORIAN NOVELISTS MAINHALL BOBBED ABOUT AMONG THE VARIOUS LITERARY CLIQUES OF LONDON AND ITS OUTLYING SUBURBS CAREFUL TO LOSE TOUCH WITH NONE OF THEM. HE HAD WRITTEN A NUMBER OF BOOKS HIMSELF AMONG THEM A HISTORY OF DANCING A HISTORY OF COSTUME A KEY TO SHAKESPEARE'S SONNETS A STUDY OF THE POETRY OF ERNEST DOWSON ET CETERA. ALTHOUGH MAINHALL'S ENTHUSIASM WAS OFTEN TIRESOME AND ALTHOUGH HE WAS OFTEN UNABLE TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN FACTS AND VIVID FIGMENTS OF HIS IMAGINATION HIS IMPERTURBABLE GOOD NATURE OVERCAME EVEN THE PEOPLE WHOM HE BORED MOST SO THAT THEY ENDED BY BECOMING IN A RELUCTANT MANNER HIS FRIENDS. HE SPOKE WITH AN EXTREME OXFORD ACCENT AND WHEN HE WAS TALKING WELL HIS FACE SOMETIMES WORE THE RAPT EXPRESSION OF A VERY EMOTIONAL MAN LISTENING TO MUSIC. MAINHALL LIKED ALEXANDER BECAUSE HE WAS AN ENGINEER. HE HAD PRECONCEIVED IDEAS ABOUT EVERYTHING AND HIS IDEA ABOUT AMERICANS WAS THAT THEY SHOULD BE ENGINEERS OR MECHANICS. HE HATED THEM WHEN THEY PRESUMED TO BE ANYTHING ELSE. WHILE THEY SAT AT DINNER MAINHALL ACQUAINTED BARTLEY WITH THE FORTUNES OF HIS OLD FRIENDS IN LONDON AND AS THEY LEFT THE TABLE HE PROPOSED THAT THEY SHOULD GO TO SEE HUGH MAC CONNELL'S NEW COMEDY BOG LIGHTS. IT'S REALLY QUITE THE BEST THING MAC CONNELL'S DONE HE EXPLAINED AS THEY GOT INTO A HANSOM. IT'S TREMENDOUSLY WELL PUT ON TOO. FLORENCE MERRILL AND CYRIL HENDERSON. BUT HILDA BURGOYNE'S THE HIT OF THE PIECE. HUGH'S WRITTEN A DELIGHTFUL PART FOR HER AND SHE'S QUITE INEXPRESSIBLE. I HAPPEN TO HAVE MAC CONNELL'S BOX FOR TONIGHT OR THERE'D BE NO CHANCE OF OUR GETTING PLACES. THERE'S EVERYTHING IN SEEING HILDA WHILE SHE'S FRESH IN A PART. SHE'S APT TO GROW A BIT STALE AFTER A TIME THE ONES WHO HAVE ANY IMAGINATION DO. HILDA BURGOYNE. ALEXANDER EXCLAIMED MILDLY. WHY I HAVEN'T HEARD OF HER FOR YEARS. MAINHALL LAUGHED. THEN YOU CAN'T HAVE HEARD MUCH AT ALL MY DEAR ALEXANDER. IT'S ONLY LATELY SINCE MAC CONNELL AND HIS SET HAVE GOT HOLD OF HER THAT SHE'S COME UP. MYSELF I ALWAYS KNEW SHE HAD IT IN HER. IF WE HAD ONE REAL CRITIC IN LONDON BUT WHAT CAN ONE EXPECT. DO YOU KNOW ALEXANDER MAINHALL LOOKED WITH PERPLEXITY UP INTO THE TOP OF THE HANSOM AND RUBBED HIS PINK CHEEK WITH HIS GLOVED FINGER DO YOU KNOW I SOMETIMES THINK OF TAKING TO CRITICISM SERIOUSLY MYSELF. IN A WAY IT WOULD BE A SACRIFICE BUT DEAR ME WE DO NEED SOME ONE. JUST THEN THEY DROVE UP TO THE DUKE OF YORK'S SO ALEXANDER DID NOT COMMIT HIMSELF BUT FOLLOWED MAINHALL INTO THE THEATRE. WHEN THEY ENTERED THE STAGE BOX ON THE LEFT THE FIRST ACT WAS WELL UNDER WAY THE SCENE BEING THE INTERIOR OF A CABIN IN THE SOUTH OF IRELAND. AS THEY SAT DOWN A BURST OF APPLAUSE DREW ALEXANDER'S ATTENTION TO THE STAGE. MISS BURGOYNE AND HER DONKEY WERE THRUSTING THEIR HEADS IN AT THE HALF DOOR. AFTER ALL HE REFLECTED THERE'S SMALL PROBABILITY OF HER RECOGNIZING ME. SHE DOUBTLESS HASN'T THOUGHT OF ME FOR YEARS. HE FELT THE ENTHUSIASM OF THE HOUSE AT ONCE AND IN A FEW MOMENTS HE WAS CAUGHT UP BY THE CURRENT OF MAC CONNELL'S IRRESISTIBLE COMEDY
