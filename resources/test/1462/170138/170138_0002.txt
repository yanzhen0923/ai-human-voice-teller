IN THE HALF LIGHT HE LOOKED ABOUT AT THE STALLS AND BOXES AND SMILED A LITTLE CONSCIOUSLY RECALLING WITH AMUSEMENT SIR HARRY'S JUDICIAL FROWN. HE WAS BEGINNING TO FEEL A KEEN INTEREST IN THE SLENDER BAREFOOT DONKEY GIRL WHO SLIPPED IN AND OUT OF THE PLAY SINGING LIKE SOME ONE WINDING THROUGH A HILLY FIELD. HE LEANED FORWARD AND BEAMED FELICITATIONS AS WARMLY AS MAINHALL HIMSELF WHEN AT THE END OF THE PLAY SHE CAME AGAIN AND AGAIN BEFORE THE CURTAIN PANTING A LITTLE AND FLUSHED HER EYES DANCING AND HER EAGER NERVOUS LITTLE MOUTH TREMULOUS WITH EXCITEMENT. HE HAD NOT THOUGHT OF HILDA BURGOYNE FOR YEARS INDEED HE HAD ALMOST FORGOTTEN HER. HE HAD LAST WRITTEN TO HER FROM CANADA AFTER HE FIRST MET WINIFRED TELLING HER THAT EVERYTHING WAS CHANGED WITH HIM THAT HE HAD MET A WOMAN WHOM HE WOULD MARRY IF HE COULD IF HE COULD NOT THEN ALL THE MORE WAS EVERYTHING CHANGED FOR HIM. HILDA HAD NEVER REPLIED TO HIS LETTER. WHEN HE WROTE HER THAT EVERYTHING WAS CHANGED FOR HIM HE WAS TELLING THE TRUTH. AFTER HE MET WINIFRED PEMBERTON HE SEEMED TO HIMSELF LIKE A DIFFERENT MAN. YOU SEE ONE CAN'T BE JEALOUS ABOUT THINGS IN GENERAL BUT ABOUT PARTICULAR DEFINITE PERSONAL THINGS HERE SHE HAD THROWN HER HANDS UP TO HIS SHOULDERS WITH A QUICK IMPULSIVE GESTURE OH ABOUT THOSE I SHOULD BE VERY JEALOUS. I SHOULD TORTURE MYSELF I COULDN'T HELP IT. AFTER THAT IT WAS EASY TO FORGET ACTUALLY TO FORGET. HE HAD BEEN IN LONDON MORE OR LESS BUT HE HAD NEVER HAPPENED TO HEAR OF HER. ALL THE SAME HE LIFTED HIS GLASS HERE'S TO YOU LITTLE HILDA. YOU'VE MADE THINGS COME YOUR WAY AND I NEVER THOUGHT YOU'D DO IT. BUT I NEVER THOUGHT SHE'D DO ANYTHING. SHE HADN'T MUCH AMBITION THEN AND SHE WAS TOO FOND OF TRIFLES. SHE MUST CARE ABOUT THE THEATRE A GREAT DEAL MORE THAN SHE USED TO. PERHAPS SHE HAS ME TO THANK FOR SOMETHING AFTER ALL. SOMETIMES A LITTLE JOLT LIKE THAT DOES ONE GOOD. I'M GLAD SHE'S HELD HER OWN SINCE. AFTER ALL WE WERE AWFULLY YOUNG. IT WAS YOUTH AND POVERTY AND PROXIMITY AND EVERYTHING WAS YOUNG AND KINDLY. I SHOULDN'T WONDER IF SHE COULD LAUGH ABOUT IT WITH ME NOW. I SHOULDN'T WONDER BUT THEY'VE PROBABLY SPOILED HER SO THAT SHE'D BE TIRESOME IF ONE MET HER AGAIN
