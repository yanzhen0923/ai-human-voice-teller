THE AUDIENCE HAD COME FOREWARNED EVIDENTLY AND WHENEVER THE RAGGED SLIP OF A DONKEY GIRL RAN UPON THE STAGE THERE WAS A DEEP MURMUR OF APPROBATION EVERY ONE SMILED AND GLOWED AND MAINHALL HITCHED HIS HEAVY CHAIR A LITTLE NEARER THE BRASS RAILING. YOU SEE HE MURMURED IN ALEXANDER'S EAR AS THE CURTAIN FELL ON THE FIRST ACT ONE ALMOST NEVER SEES A PART LIKE THAT DONE WITHOUT SMARTNESS OR MAWKISHNESS. OF COURSE HILDA IS IRISH THE BURGOYNES HAVE BEEN STAGE PEOPLE FOR GENERATIONS AND SHE HAS THE IRISH VOICE. IT'S DELIGHTFUL TO HEAR IT IN A LONDON THEATRE. THAT LAUGH NOW WHEN SHE DOUBLES OVER AT THE HIPS WHO EVER HEARD IT OUT OF GALWAY SHE SAVES HER HAND TOO. SHE'S AT HER BEST IN THE SECOND ACT. SHE'S REALLY MAC CONNELL'S POETIC MOTIF YOU SEE MAKES THE WHOLE THING A FAIRY TALE. ALEXANDER ANNOYED BY MAINHALL'S SIGHS AND EXCLAMATIONS WATCHED HER WITH KEEN HALF SKEPTICAL INTEREST. AS MAINHALL HAD SAID SHE WAS THE SECOND ACT THE PLOT AND FEELING ALIKE DEPENDED UPON HER LIGHTNESS OF FOOT HER LIGHTNESS OF TOUCH UPON THE SHREWDNESS AND DEFT FANCIFULNESS THAT PLAYED ALTERNATELY AND SOMETIMES TOGETHER IN HER MIRTHFUL BROWN EYES. WHEN SHE BEGAN TO DANCE BY WAY OF SHOWING THE GOSSOONS WHAT SHE HAD SEEN IN THE FAIRY RINGS AT NIGHT THE HOUSE BROKE INTO A PROLONGED UPROAR. AFTER HER DANCE SHE WITHDREW FROM THE DIALOGUE AND RETREATED TO THE DITCH WALL BACK OF PHILLY'S BURROW WHERE SHE SAT SINGING THE RISING OF THE MOON AND MAKING A WREATH OF PRIMROSES FOR HER DONKEY. WHEN THE ACT WAS OVER ALEXANDER AND MAINHALL STROLLED OUT INTO THE CORRIDOR. THEY MET A GOOD MANY ACQUAINTANCES MAINHALL INDEED KNEW ALMOST EVERY ONE AND HE BABBLED ON INCONTINENTLY SCREWING HIS SMALL HEAD ABOUT OVER HIS HIGH COLLAR. MAC CONNELL LET ME INTRODUCE MISTER BARTLEY ALEXANDER. I SAY IT'S GOING FAMOUSLY TO NIGHT MAC AND WHAT AN AUDIENCE. YOU'LL NEVER DO ANYTHING LIKE THIS AGAIN MARK ME. A MAN WRITES TO THE TOP OF HIS BENT ONLY ONCE. THE PLAYWRIGHT GAVE MAINHALL A CURIOUS LOOK OUT OF HIS DEEP SET FADED EYES AND MADE A WRY FACE. AND YOU'LL NEVER BRING HILDA OUT LIKE THIS AGAIN. DEAR ME MAC THE GIRL COULDN'T POSSIBLY BE BETTER YOU KNOW MAC CONNELL GRUNTED. HE NODDED CURTLY AND MADE FOR THE DOOR DODGING ACQUAINTANCES AS HE WENT. POOR OLD HUGH MAINHALL MURMURED HE'S HIT TERRIBLY HARD. HE'S BEEN WANTING TO MARRY HILDA THESE THREE YEARS AND MORE. SHE DOESN'T TAKE UP WITH ANYBODY YOU KNOW. ONE OF YOUR COUNTRYMEN ALEXANDER BY THE WAY AN AMERICAN STUDENT WHOM SHE MET IN PARIS I BELIEVE. I DARE SAY IT'S QUITE TRUE THAT THERE'S NEVER BEEN ANY ONE ELSE. MAINHALL VOUCHED FOR HER CONSTANCY WITH A LOFTINESS THAT MADE ALEXANDER SMILE EVEN WHILE A KIND OF RAPID EXCITEMENT WAS TINGLING THROUGH HIM. BLINKING UP AT THE LIGHTS MAINHALL ADDED IN HIS LUXURIOUS WORLDLY WAY SHE'S AN ELEGANT LITTLE PERSON AND QUITE CAPABLE OF AN EXTRAVAGANT BIT OF SENTIMENT LIKE THAT. HERE COMES SIR HARRY TOWNE. HE'S ANOTHER WHO'S AWFULLY KEEN ABOUT HER LET ME INTRODUCE YOU. SIR HARRY TOWNE MISTER BARTLEY ALEXANDER THE AMERICAN ENGINEER. SIR HARRY TOWNE BOWED AND SAID THAT HE HAD MET MISTER ALEXANDER AND HIS WIFE IN TOKYO. MAINHALL CUT IN IMPATIENTLY. I SAY SIR HARRY THE LITTLE GIRL'S GOING FAMOUSLY TO NIGHT ISN'T SHE. SIR HARRY WRINKLED HIS BROWS JUDICIOUSLY. THE FACT IS SHE'S FEELING RATHER SEEDY POOR CHILD. A LITTLE ATTACK OF NERVES POSSIBLY. HE BOWED AS THE WARNING BELL RANG AND MAINHALL WHISPERED YOU KNOW LORD WESTMERE OF COURSE THE STOOPED MAN WITH THE LONG GRAY MUSTACHE TALKING TO LADY DOWLE. LADY WESTMERE IS VERY FOND OF HILDA. WHEN THEY REACHED THEIR BOX THE HOUSE WAS DARKENED AND THE ORCHESTRA WAS PLAYING THE CLOAK OF OLD GAUL. IN A MOMENT PEGGY WAS ON THE STAGE AGAIN AND ALEXANDER APPLAUDED VIGOROUSLY WITH THE REST. FOR SOME REASON HE FELT PLEASED AND FLATTERED BY THE ENTHUSIASM OF THE AUDIENCE
