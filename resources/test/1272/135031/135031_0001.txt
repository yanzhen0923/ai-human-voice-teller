HOORAY CRIED BETSY I'M GLAD OF THAT KING KALIKO I SALUTE YOUR MAJESTY AND WISH YOU JOY IN YOUR GLOOMY OLD KINGDOM. WE ALL WISH HIM JOY SAID POLYCHROME AND THEN THE OTHERS MADE HASTE TO CONGRATULATE THE NEW KING. WILL YOU RELEASE MY DEAR BROTHER ASKED SHAGGY THE UGLY ONE. VERY WILLINGLY REPLIED KALIKO. I BEGGED RUGGEDO LONG AGO TO SEND HIM AWAY BUT HE WOULD NOT DO SO. I ALSO OFFERED TO HELP YOUR BROTHER TO ESCAPE BUT HE WOULD NOT GO. HE'S SO CONSCIENTIOUS SAID SHAGGY HIGHLY PLEASED. ALL OF OUR FAMILY HAVE NOBLE NATURES. BUT IS MY DEAR BROTHER WELL HE ADDED ANXIOUSLY. HE EATS AND SLEEPS VERY STEADILY REPLIED THE NEW KING. I HOPE HE DOESN'T WORK TOO HARD SAID SHAGGY. HE DOESN'T WORK AT ALL. IN FACT THERE IS NOTHING HE CAN DO IN THESE DOMINIONS AS WELL AS OUR NOMES WHOSE NUMBERS ARE SO GREAT THAT IT WORRIES US TO KEEP THEM ALL BUSY. SO YOUR BROTHER HAS ONLY TO AMUSE HIMSELF. WHY IT'S MORE LIKE VISITING THAN BEING A PRISONER ASSERTED BETSY. NOT EXACTLY RETURNED KALIKO. A PRISONER CANNOT GO WHERE OR WHEN HE PLEASES AND IS NOT HIS OWN MASTER. WHERE IS MY BROTHER NOW. INQUIRED SHAGGY IN THE METAL FOREST. WHERE IS THAT. THE METAL FOREST IS IN THE GREAT DOMED CAVERN THE LARGEST IN ALL OUR DOMINIONS REPLIED KALIKO. IT IS ALMOST LIKE BEING OUT OF DOORS IT IS SO BIG AND RUGGEDO MADE THE WONDERFUL FOREST TO AMUSE HIMSELF AS WELL AS TO TIRE OUT HIS HARD WORKING NOMES. ALL THE TREES ARE GOLD AND SILVER AND THE GROUND IS STREWN WITH PRECIOUS STONES SO IT IS A SORT OF TREASURY. LET US GO THERE AT ONCE AND RESCUE MY DEAR BROTHER PLEADED SHAGGY EARNESTLY. KALIKO HESITATED. I DON'T BELIEVE I CAN FIND THE WAY SAID HE. RUGGEDO MADE THREE SECRET PASSAGES TO THE METAL FOREST BUT HE CHANGES THE LOCATION OF THESE PASSAGES EVERY WEEK SO THAT NO ONE CAN GET TO THE METAL FOREST WITHOUT HIS PERMISSION. HOWEVER IF WE LOOK SHARP WE MAY BE ABLE TO DISCOVER ONE OF THESE SECRET WAYS. I'M SURE I CAN'T SAY REPLIED KALIKO. DO YOU SUPPOSE RUGGEDO DESTROYED THEM. OH NO I'M QUITE SURE HE DIDN'T. THAT'S FUNNY REMARKED BETSY THOUGHTFULLY. I DON'T BELIEVE ANN KNEW ANY MAGIC OR SHE'D HAVE WORKED IT BEFORE. BUT TO DISAPPEAR LIKE THAT SEEMS LIKE MAGIC NOW DOESN'T IT. THEY AGREED THAT IT DID BUT NO ONE COULD EXPLAIN THE MYSTERY. AND THE IMPORTANT THING JUST NOW IS TO RESCUE MY DEAR BROTHER FROM CAPTIVITY. WHY DO THEY CALL HIM THE UGLY ONE ASKED BETSY. I DO NOT KNOW CONFESSED SHAGGY. I CAN NOT REMEMBER HIS LOOKS VERY WELL IT IS SO LONG SINCE I HAVE SEEN HIM BUT ALL OF OUR FAMILY ARE NOTED FOR THEIR HANDSOME FACES. BETSY LAUGHED AND SHAGGY SEEMED RATHER HURT BUT POLYCHROME RELIEVED HIS EMBARRASSMENT BY SAYING SOFTLY ONE CAN BE UGLY IN LOOKS BUT LOVELY IN DISPOSITION. OUR FIRST TASK SAID SHAGGY A LITTLE COMFORTED BY THIS REMARK IS TO FIND ONE OF THOSE SECRET PASSAGES TO THE METAL FOREST. TRUE AGREED KALIKO. SO I THINK I WILL ASSEMBLE THE CHIEF NOMES OF MY KINGDOM IN THIS THRONE ROOM AND TELL THEM THAT I AM THEIR NEW KING. THEN I CAN ASK THEM TO ASSIST US IN SEARCHING FOR THE SECRET PASSAGES. THAT'S A GOOD IDEA SAID THE DRAGON WHO SEEMED TO BE GETTING SLEEPY AGAIN
