KALIKO WENT TO THE BIG GONG AND POUNDED ON IT JUST AS RUGGEDO USED TO DO BUT NO ONE ANSWERED THE SUMMONS. OF COURSE NOT SAID HE JUMPING UP FROM THE THRONE WHERE HE HAD SEATED HIMSELF. THAT IS MY CALL AND I AM STILL THE ROYAL CHAMBERLAIN AND WILL BE UNTIL I APPOINT ANOTHER IN MY PLACE. HAVING RETURNED TO THE ROYAL CAVERN KALIKO FIRST POUNDED THE GONG AND THEN SAT IN THE THRONE WEARING RUGGEDO'S DISCARDED RUBY CROWN AND HOLDING IN HIS HAND THE SCEPTRE WHICH RUGGEDO HAD SO OFTEN THROWN AT HIS HEAD. WHEN GUPH ENTERED HE WAS AMAZED. BETTER GET OUT OF THAT THRONE BEFORE OLD RUGGEDO COMES BACK HE SAID WARNINGLY. ALL OF WHICH IS QUITE TRUE ASSERTED THE DRAGON AND ALL OF THOSE WHO STOOD AROUND THE THRONE BOWED RESPECTFULLY TO THE NEW KING
