AFTER THE KING HAD MADE GOOD HIS ESCAPE FILES SAID TO THE DRAGON IN A SAD VOICE ALAS. WHY DID YOU NOT COME BEFORE. BECAUSE YOU WERE SLEEPING INSTEAD OF CONQUERING THE LOVELY ROSE PRINCESS HAS BECOME A FIDDLE WITHOUT A BOW WHILE POOR SHAGGY SITS THERE A COOING DOVE. DON'T WORRY REPLIED QUOX. TITITI HOOCHOO KNOWS HIS BUSINESS AND I HAVE MY ORDERS FROM THE GREAT JINJIN HIMSELF. BRING THE FIDDLE HERE AND TOUCH IT LIGHTLY TO MY PINK RIBBON. NEXT INSTANT SHAGGY WAS HIMSELF AGAIN AND QUOX SAID TO HIM GRUMBLINGLY. PLEASE GET OFF MY LEFT TOE SHAGGY MAN AND BE MORE PARTICULAR WHERE YOU STEP. I BEG YOUR PARDON. THEN HE RAN TO LIFT THE HEAVY DIAMOND OFF TIK TOK'S CHEST AND TO ASSIST THE CLOCKWORK MAN TO HIS FEET. HE HAS GONE AND GONE FOR GOOD ANSWERED POLYCHROME WHO HAD MANAGED TO SQUEEZE INTO THE ROOM BESIDE THE DRAGON AND HAD WITNESSED THE OCCURRENCES WITH MUCH INTEREST. BUT I WONDER WHERE BETSY BOBBIN AND HANK CAN BE AND IF ANY HARM HAS BEFALLEN THEM. WE MUST SEARCH THE CAVERN UNTIL WE FIND THEM DECLARED SHAGGY BUT WHEN HE WENT TO THE DOOR LEADING TO THE OTHER CAVERNS HE FOUND IT SHUT AND BARRED. BUT YOU ARE A PRISONER AND THE CHAINS THAT HOLD YOU ARE FASTENED IN SOME OTHER ROOM SO THAT WE CANNOT RELEASE YOU FILES SAID ANXIOUSLY. I HAVE REMAINED A PRISONER ONLY BECAUSE I WISHED TO BE ONE AND WITH THIS HE STEPPED FORWARD AND BURST THE STOUT CHAINS AS EASILY AS IF THEY HAD BEEN THREADS. BUT WHEN HE TRIED TO PUSH IN THE HEAVY METAL DOOR EVEN HIS MIGHTY STRENGTH FAILED AND AFTER SEVERAL ATTEMPTS HE GAVE IT UP AND SQUATTED HIMSELF IN A CORNER TO THINK OF A BETTER WAY. I'LL O PEN THE DOOR ASSERTED TIK TOK AND GOING TO THE KING'S BIG GONG HE POUNDED UPON IT UNTIL THE NOISE WAS ALMOST DEAFENING. KALIKO IN THE NEXT CAVERN WAS WONDERING WHAT HAD HAPPENED TO RUGGEDO AND IF HE HAD ESCAPED THE EGGS AND OUTWITTED THE DRAGON. BUT THE EGGS WERE ALSO GONE AND SO KALIKO ADVANCED TO THE DRAGON WHOM HE KNEW TO BE TITITI HOOCHOO'S MESSENGER AND BOWED HUMBLY BEFORE THE BEAST. WHAT IS YOUR WILL HE INQUIRED. WHERE IS BETSY DEMANDED THE DRAGON. SAFE IN MY OWN PRIVATE ROOM SAID KALIKO. GO AND GET HER COMMANDED QUOX. SO KALIKO WENT TO BETSY'S ROOM AND GAVE THREE RAPS UPON THE DOOR. THE LITTLE GIRL HAD BEEN ASLEEP BUT SHE HEARD THE RAPS AND OPENED THE DOOR. YOU MAY COME OUT NOW SAID KALIKO. THE KING HAS FLED IN DISGRACE AND YOUR FRIENDS ARE ASKING FOR YOU. SO BETSY AND HANK RETURNED WITH THE ROYAL CHAMBERLAIN TO THE THRONE CAVERN WHERE SHE WAS RECEIVED WITH GREAT JOY BY HER FRIENDS. THEY TOLD HER WHAT HAD HAPPENED TO RUGGEDO AND SHE TOLD THEM HOW KIND KALIKO HAD BEEN TO HER. QUOX DID NOT HAVE MUCH TO SAY UNTIL THE CONVERSATION WAS ENDED BUT THEN HE TURNED TO KALIKO AND ASKED. DO YOU SUPPOSE YOU COULD RULE YOUR NOMES BETTER THAN RUGGEDO HAS DONE. WELL I COULDN'T BE A WORSE KING I'M SURE. WOULD THE NOMES OBEY YOU. THEY LIKE ME BETTER THAN EVER THEY DID RUGGEDO. THEN HEREAFTER YOU SHALL BE THE METAL MONARCH KING OF THE NOMES AND TITITI HOOCHOO EXPECTS YOU TO RULE YOUR KINGDOM WISELY AND WELL SAID QUOX
