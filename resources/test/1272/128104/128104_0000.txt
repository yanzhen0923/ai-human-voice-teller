TO MANY NO DOUBT HE WILL SEEM TO BE SOMEWHAT BLATANT AND BUMPTIOUS BUT WE PREFER TO REGARD HIM AS BEING SIMPLY BRITISH. MISTER QUILTER IS THE APOSTLE OF THE MIDDLE CLASSES AND WE ARE GLAD TO WELCOME HIS GOSPEL. NOR IS MISTER QUILTER'S MANNER LESS INTERESTING THAN HIS MATTER. HE TELLS US THAT AT THIS FESTIVE SEASON OF THE YEAR WITH CHRISTMAS AND ROAST BEEF LOOMING BEFORE US SIMILES DRAWN FROM EATING AND ITS RESULTS OCCUR MOST READILY TO THE MIND. IN GAINSBOROUGH HE SEES A PLAINNESS ALMOST AMOUNTING TO BRUTALITY WHILE VULGARITY AND SNOBBISHNESS ARE THE CHIEF QUALITIES HE FINDS IN SIR JOSHUA REYNOLDS. HE HAS GRAVE DOUBTS WHETHER SIR FREDERICK LEIGHTON'S WORK IS REALLY GREEK AFTER ALL AND CAN DISCOVER IN IT BUT LITTLE OF ROCKY ITHACA. MISTER POYNTER HOWEVER IS A CART HORSE COMPARED TO THE PRESIDENT AND FREDERICK WALKER WAS A DULL GREEK BECAUSE HE HAD NO SYMPATHY WITH POETRY. LINNELL'S PICTURES ARE A SORT OF UP GUARDS AND AT EM PAINTINGS AND MASON'S EXQUISITE IDYLLS ARE AS NATIONAL AS A JINGO POEM MISTER BIRKET FOSTER'S LANDSCAPES SMILE AT ONE MUCH IN THE SAME WAY THAT MISTER CARKER USED TO FLASH HIS TEETH AND MISTER JOHN COLLIER GIVES HIS SITTER A CHEERFUL SLAP ON THE BACK BEFORE HE SAYS LIKE A SHAMPOOER IN A TURKISH BATH NEXT MAN. MISTER HERKOMER'S ART IS IF NOT A CATCH PENNY ART AT ALL EVENTS A CATCH MANY POUNDS ART AND MISTER W B RICHMOND IS A CLEVER TRIFLER WHO MIGHT DO REALLY GOOD WORK IF HE WOULD EMPLOY HIS TIME IN LEARNING TO PAINT. IT IS OBVIOUSLY UNNECESSARY FOR US TO POINT OUT HOW LUMINOUS THESE CRITICISMS ARE HOW DELICATE IN EXPRESSION. THE REMARKS ON SIR JOSHUA REYNOLDS ALONE EXEMPLIFY THE TRUTH OF SENTENTIA NO NINETEEN FROM A PICTURE WE GAIN BUT LITTLE MORE THAN WE BRING. ON THE GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF ART MISTER QUILTER WRITES WITH EQUAL LUCIDITY. PAINTING HE TELLS US IS OF A DIFFERENT QUALITY TO MATHEMATICS AND FINISH IN ART IS ADDING MORE FACT. AS FOR ETCHINGS THEY ARE OF TWO KINDS BRITISH AND FOREIGN. THE LATTER FAIL IN PROPRIETY. YET REALLY FINE ETCHING IS AS FREE AND EASY AS IS THE CHAT BETWEEN OLD CHUMS AT MIDNIGHT OVER A SMOKING ROOM FIRE. ANY ONE HE POINTS OUT CAN PAINT IN GOOD TONE WHO PAINTS ONLY IN BLACK AND WHITE AND THE GREAT SIGN OF A GOOD DECORATOR IS HIS CAPABILITY OF DOING WITHOUT NEUTRAL TINTS. INDEED ON DECORATION MISTER QUILTER IS ALMOST ELOQUENT. HE LAMENTS MOST BITTERLY THE DIVORCE THAT HAS BEEN MADE BETWEEN DECORATIVE ART AND WHAT WE USUALLY CALL PICTURES MAKES THE CUSTOMARY APPEAL TO THE LAST JUDGMENT AND REMINDS US THAT IN THE GREAT DAYS OF ART MICHAEL ANGELO WAS THE FURNISHING UPHOLSTERER. WITH THE PRESENT TENDENCIES OF DECORATIVE ART IN ENGLAND MISTER QUILTER CONSEQUENTLY HAS BUT LITTLE SYMPATHY AND HE MAKES A GALLANT APPEAL TO THE BRITISH HOUSEHOLDER TO STAND NO MORE NONSENSE. LET THE HONEST FELLOW HE SAYS ON HIS RETURN FROM HIS COUNTING HOUSE TEAR DOWN THE PERSIAN HANGINGS PUT A CHOP ON THE ANATOLIAN PLATE MIX SOME TODDY IN THE VENETIAN GLASS AND CARRY HIS WIFE OFF TO THE NATIONAL GALLERY TO LOOK AT OUR OWN MULREADY.
