A RED HAIRED MOUNTAIN OF A MAN WITH AN APPARENTLY INEXHAUSTIBLE STORE OF ENERGY. THAT WAS REALLY ALL THAT COUNTED NOW. THERE COULD BE LITTLE ART IN THIS LAST AND FINAL ROUND OF FENCING. JUST THRUST AND PARRY AND VICTORY TO THE STRONGER. EVERY MAN WHO ENTERED THE TWENTIES HAD HIS OWN TRAINING TRICKS. HE HAD A STANDING ORDER WITH OFF PLANET AGENTS FOR ARCHAIC CHESS BOOKS THE OLDER THE BETTER. HE HAD MEMORIZED THOUSANDS OF THESE ANCIENT GAMES AND OPENINGS THIS WAS ALLOWED. ANYTHING WAS ALLOWED THAT DIDN'T INVOLVE DRUGS OR MACHINES. SELF HYPNOSIS WAS AN ACCEPTED TOOL. COMMON AS THE PHENOMENON SEEMED TO BE IN THE TEXTBOOKS IT PROVED IMPOSSIBLE TO DUPLICATE. THERE APPEARED TO BE AN IMMEDIATE ASSOCIATION WITH THE DEATH TRAUMA AS IF THE TWO WERE INEXTRICABLY LINKED INTO ONE. BERSERKERS AND JURAMENTADOS CONTINUE TO FIGHT AND KILL THOUGH CARVED BY SCORES OF MORTAL WOUNDS. MEN WITH BULLETS IN THE HEART OR BRAIN FIGHT ON THOUGH ALREADY CLINICALLY DEAD. DEATH SEEMED AN INESCAPABLE PART OF THIS KIND OF STRENGTH. BUT THERE WAS ANOTHER TYPE THAT COULD EASILY BE BROUGHT ABOUT IN ANY DEEP TRANCE HYPNOTIC RIGIDITY. THE STRENGTH THAT ENABLES SOMEONE IN A TRANCE TO HOLD HIS BODY STIFF AND UNSUPPORTED EXCEPT AT TWO POINTS THE HEAD AND HEELS. THIS IS PHYSICALLY IMPOSSIBLE WHEN CONSCIOUS. WORKING WITH THIS AS A CLUE BRION HAD DEVELOPED A SELF HYPNOTIC TECHNIQUE THAT ALLOWED HIM TO TAP THIS RESERVOIR OF UNKNOWN STRENGTH THE SOURCE OF SECOND WIND THE SURVIVAL STRENGTH THAT MADE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN LIFE AND DEATH. BUT THAT WASN'T IMPORTANT. OTHERS HAD DIED BEFORE DURING THE TWENTIES AND DEATH DURING THE LAST ROUND WAS IN SOME WAYS EASIER THAN DEFEAT. BREATHING DEEPLY BRION SOFTLY SPOKE THE AUTO HYPNOTIC PHRASES THAT TRIGGERED THE PROCESS. FATIGUE FELL SOFTLY FROM HIM AS DID ALL SENSATIONS OF HEAT COLD AND PAIN. HE COULD FEEL WITH ACUTE SENSITIVITY HEAR AND SEE CLEARLY WHEN HE OPENED HIS EYES. WITH EACH PASSING SECOND THE POWER DREW AT THE BASIC RESERVES OF LIFE DRAINING IT FROM HIS BODY. WHEN THE BUZZER SOUNDED HE PULLED HIS FOIL FROM HIS SECOND'S STARTLED GRASP AND RAN FORWARD. THE FORCE OF HIS RUSH WAS SO GREAT THAT THE GUARDS ON THEIR WEAPONS LOCKED AND THEIR BODIES CRASHED TOGETHER. IROLG LOOKED AMAZED AT THE SUDDEN FURY OF THE ATTACK THEN SMILED. HE THOUGHT IT WAS A LAST BURST OF ENERGY HE KNEW HOW CLOSE THEY BOTH WERE TO EXHAUSTION. THIS MUST BE THE END FOR BRION. THEY DISENGAGED AND IROLG PUT UP A SOLID DEFENSE. BRION SAW SOMETHING CLOSE TO PANIC ON HIS OPPONENT'S FACE WHEN THE MAN FINALLY RECOGNIZED HIS ERROR. BRION WASN'T TIRING. IF ANYTHING HE WAS PRESSING THE ATTACK. A WAVE OF DESPAIR ROLLED OUT FROM IROLG BRION SENSED IT AND KNEW THE FIFTH POINT WAS HIS. THRUST THRUST AND EACH TIME THE PARRYING SWORD A LITTLE SLOWER TO RETURN. THEN THE POWERFUL TWIST THAT THRUST IT ASIDE IN AND UNDER THE GUARD. THE SLAP OF THE BUTTON ON FLESH AND THE ARC OF STEEL THAT REACHED OUT AND ENDED ON IROLG'S CHEST OVER HIS HEART. WAVES OF SOUND CHEERING AND SCREAMING LAPPED AGAINST BRION'S PRIVATE WORLD BUT HE WAS ONLY REMOTELY AWARE OF THEIR EXISTENCE. IROLG DROPPED HIS FOIL AND TRIED TO SHAKE BRION'S HAND BUT HIS LEGS SUDDENLY GAVE WAY
