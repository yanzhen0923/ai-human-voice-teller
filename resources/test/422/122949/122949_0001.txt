SUCH A TYPE OF MAN IS EVEN PROUD OF NOT BEING MADE FOR SYMPATHY THE HERO OF THE SAGA THEREFORE ADDS WARNINGLY HE WHO HAS NOT A HARD HEART WHEN YOUNG WILL NEVER HAVE ONE. IT IS THE POWERFUL WHO KNOW HOW TO HONOUR IT IS THEIR ART THEIR DOMAIN FOR INVENTION. PROBABLY A PESSIMISTIC SUSPICION WITH REGARD TO THE ENTIRE SITUATION OF MAN WILL FIND EXPRESSION PERHAPS A CONDEMNATION OF MAN TOGETHER WITH HIS SITUATION. THE SLAVE HAS AN UNFAVOURABLE EYE FOR THE VIRTUES OF THE POWERFUL HE HAS A SKEPTICISM AND DISTRUST A REFINEMENT OF DISTRUST OF EVERYTHING GOOD THAT IS THERE HONOURED HE WOULD FAIN PERSUADE HIMSELF THAT THE VERY HAPPINESS THERE IS NOT GENUINE. SLAVE MORALITY IS ESSENTIALLY THE MORALITY OF UTILITY. HERE IS THE SEAT OF THE ORIGIN OF THE FAMOUS ANTITHESIS GOOD AND EVIL POWER AND DANGEROUSNESS ARE ASSUMED TO RESIDE IN THE EVIL A CERTAIN DREADFULNESS SUBTLETY AND STRENGTH WHICH DO NOT ADMIT OF BEING DESPISED. ACCORDING TO SLAVE MORALITY THEREFORE THE EVIL MAN AROUSES FEAR ACCORDING TO MASTER MORALITY IT IS PRECISELY THE GOOD MAN WHO AROUSES FEAR AND SEEKS TO AROUSE IT WHILE THE BAD MAN IS REGARDED AS THE DESPICABLE BEING. THE CONTRAST ATTAINS ITS MAXIMUM WHEN IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LOGICAL CONSEQUENCES OF SLAVE MORALITY A SHADE OF DEPRECIATION IT MAY BE SLIGHT AND WELL INTENTIONED AT LAST ATTACHES ITSELF TO THE GOOD MAN OF THIS MORALITY BECAUSE ACCORDING TO THE SERVILE MODE OF THOUGHT THE GOOD MAN MUST IN ANY CASE BE THE SAFE MAN HE IS GOOD NATURED EASILY DECEIVED PERHAPS A LITTLE STUPID UN BONHOMME. EVERYWHERE THAT SLAVE MORALITY GAINS THE ASCENDANCY LANGUAGE SHOWS A TENDENCY TO APPROXIMATE THE SIGNIFICATIONS OF THE WORDS GOOD AND STUPID. THIS SEEMS TO HIM ON THE ONE HAND SUCH BAD TASTE AND SO SELF DISRESPECTFUL AND ON THE OTHER HAND SO GROTESQUELY UNREASONABLE THAT HE WOULD LIKE TO CONSIDER VANITY AN EXCEPTION AND IS DOUBTFUL ABOUT IT IN MOST CASES WHEN IT IS SPOKEN OF. HE WILL SAY FOR INSTANCE I MAY BE MISTAKEN ABOUT MY VALUE AND ON THE OTHER HAND MAY NEVERTHELESS DEMAND THAT MY VALUE SHOULD BE ACKNOWLEDGED BY OTHERS PRECISELY AS I RATE IT THAT HOWEVER IS NOT VANITY BUT SELF CONCEIT OR IN MOST CASES THAT WHICH IS CALLED HUMILITY AND ALSO MODESTY. OR HE WILL EVEN SAY FOR MANY REASONS I CAN DELIGHT IN THE GOOD OPINION OF OTHERS PERHAPS BECAUSE I LOVE AND HONOUR THEM AND REJOICE IN ALL THEIR JOYS PERHAPS ALSO BECAUSE THEIR GOOD OPINION ENDORSES AND STRENGTHENS MY BELIEF IN MY OWN GOOD OPINION PERHAPS BECAUSE THE GOOD OPINION OF OTHERS EVEN IN CASES WHERE I DO NOT SHARE IT IS USEFUL TO ME OR GIVES PROMISE OF USEFULNESS ALL THIS HOWEVER IS NOT VANITY. IN FACT CONFORMABLY TO THE SLOW RISE OF THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIAL ORDER AND ITS CAUSE THE BLENDING OF THE BLOOD OF MASTERS AND SLAVES THE ORIGINALLY NOBLE AND RARE IMPULSE OF THE MASTERS TO ASSIGN A VALUE TO THEMSELVES AND TO THINK WELL OF THEMSELVES WILL NOW BE MORE AND MORE ENCOURAGED AND EXTENDED BUT IT HAS AT ALL TIMES AN OLDER AMPLER AND MORE RADICALLY INGRAINED PROPENSITY OPPOSED TO IT AND IN THE PHENOMENON OF VANITY THIS OLDER PROPENSITY OVERMASTERS THE YOUNGER. NOW LOOK AT AN ARISTOCRATIC COMMONWEALTH SAY AN ANCIENT GREEK POLIS OR VENICE AS A VOLUNTARY OR INVOLUNTARY CONTRIVANCE FOR THE PURPOSE OF REARING HUMAN BEINGS THERE ARE THERE MEN BESIDE ONE ANOTHER THROWN UPON THEIR OWN RESOURCES WHO WANT TO MAKE THEIR SPECIES PREVAIL CHIEFLY BECAUSE THEY MUST PREVAIL OR ELSE RUN THE TERRIBLE DANGER OF BEING EXTERMINATED
