TO SUFFOCATE WITH HIS MEMORIES TO HIM WHO HAS THE DESIRES OF A LOFTY AND DAINTY SOUL AND ONLY SELDOM FINDS HIS TABLE LAID AND HIS FOOD PREPARED THE DANGER WILL ALWAYS BE GREAT NOWADAYS HOWEVER IT IS EXTRAORDINARILY SO. TO BE ABLE TO ALLOW ONESELF THIS VERITABLE LUXURY OF TASTE AND MORALITY ONE MUST NOT LIVE AMONG INTELLECTUAL IMBECILES BUT RATHER AMONG MEN WHOSE MISUNDERSTANDINGS AND MISTAKES AMUSE BY THEIR REFINEMENT OR ONE WILL HAVE TO PAY DEARLY FOR IT HE PRAISES ME THEREFORE HE ACKNOWLEDGES ME TO BE RIGHT THIS ASININE METHOD OF INFERENCE SPOILS HALF OF THE LIFE OF US RECLUSES FOR IT BRINGS THE ASSES INTO OUR NEIGHBOURHOOD AND FRIENDSHIP. TO CONSERVE ONE'S THREE HUNDRED FOREGROUNDS ALSO ONE'S BLACK SPECTACLES FOR THERE ARE CIRCUMSTANCES WHEN NOBODY MUST LOOK INTO OUR EYES STILL LESS INTO OUR MOTIVES. AND TO CHOOSE FOR COMPANY THAT ROGUISH AND CHEERFUL VICE POLITENESS. SOMETHING HAPPENS THERE AS IN THE REALM OF STARS
