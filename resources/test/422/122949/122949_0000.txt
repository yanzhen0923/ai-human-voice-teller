EVERY ELEVATION OF THE TYPE MAN HAS HITHERTO BEEN THE WORK OF AN ARISTOCRATIC SOCIETY AND SO IT WILL ALWAYS BE A SOCIETY BELIEVING IN A LONG SCALE OF GRADATIONS OF RANK AND DIFFERENCES OF WORTH AMONG HUMAN BEINGS AND REQUIRING SLAVERY IN SOME FORM OR OTHER. TO BE SURE ONE MUST NOT RESIGN ONESELF TO ANY HUMANITARIAN ILLUSIONS ABOUT THE HISTORY OF THE ORIGIN OF AN ARISTOCRATIC SOCIETY THAT IS TO SAY OF THE PRELIMINARY CONDITION FOR THE ELEVATION OF THE TYPE MAN THE TRUTH IS HARD. AS SOON HOWEVER AS ONE WISHED TO TAKE THIS PRINCIPLE MORE GENERALLY AND IF POSSIBLE EVEN AS THE FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLE OF SOCIETY IT WOULD IMMEDIATELY DISCLOSE WHAT IT REALLY IS NAMELY A WILL TO THE DENIAL OF LIFE A PRINCIPLE OF DISSOLUTION AND DECAY. ON NO POINT HOWEVER IS THE ORDINARY CONSCIOUSNESS OF EUROPEANS MORE UNWILLING TO BE CORRECTED THAN ON THIS MATTER PEOPLE NOW RAVE EVERYWHERE EVEN UNDER THE GUISE OF SCIENCE ABOUT COMING CONDITIONS OF SOCIETY IN WHICH THE EXPLOITING CHARACTER IS TO BE ABSENT THAT SOUNDS TO MY EARS AS IF THEY PROMISED TO INVENT A MODE OF LIFE WHICH SHOULD REFRAIN FROM ALL ORGANIC FUNCTIONS. THERE IS MASTER MORALITY AND SLAVE MORALITY I WOULD AT ONCE ADD HOWEVER THAT IN ALL HIGHER AND MIXED CIVILIZATIONS THERE ARE ALSO ATTEMPTS AT THE RECONCILIATION OF THE TWO MORALITIES BUT ONE FINDS STILL OFTENER THE CONFUSION AND MUTUAL MISUNDERSTANDING OF THEM INDEED SOMETIMES THEIR CLOSE JUXTAPOSITION EVEN IN THE SAME MAN WITHIN ONE SOUL. THE DISTINCTIONS OF MORAL VALUES HAVE EITHER ORIGINATED IN A RULING CASTE PLEASANTLY CONSCIOUS OF BEING DIFFERENT FROM THE RULED OR AMONG THE RULED CLASS THE SLAVES AND DEPENDENTS OF ALL SORTS. THE NOBLE TYPE OF MAN SEPARATES FROM HIMSELF THE BEINGS IN WHOM THE OPPOSITE OF THIS EXALTED PROUD DISPOSITION DISPLAYS ITSELF HE DESPISES THEM. LET IT AT ONCE BE NOTED THAT IN THIS FIRST KIND OF MORALITY THE ANTITHESIS GOOD AND BAD MEANS PRACTICALLY THE SAME AS NOBLE AND DESPICABLE THE ANTITHESIS GOOD AND EVIL IS OF A DIFFERENT ORIGIN. THE COWARDLY THE TIMID THE INSIGNIFICANT AND THOSE THINKING MERELY OF NARROW UTILITY ARE DESPISED MOREOVER ALSO THE DISTRUSTFUL WITH THEIR CONSTRAINED GLANCES THE SELF ABASING THE DOG LIKE KIND OF MEN WHO LET THEMSELVES BE ABUSED THE MENDICANT FLATTERERS AND ABOVE ALL THE LIARS IT IS A FUNDAMENTAL BELIEF OF ALL ARISTOCRATS THAT THE COMMON PEOPLE ARE UNTRUTHFUL. WE TRUTHFUL ONES THE NOBILITY IN ANCIENT GREECE CALLED THEMSELVES. IT IS OBVIOUS THAT EVERYWHERE THE DESIGNATIONS OF MORAL VALUE WERE AT FIRST APPLIED TO MEN AND WERE ONLY DERIVATIVELY AND AT A LATER PERIOD APPLIED TO ACTIONS IT IS A GROSS MISTAKE THEREFORE WHEN HISTORIANS OF MORALS START WITH QUESTIONS LIKE WHY HAVE SYMPATHETIC ACTIONS BEEN PRAISED. THE NOBLE TYPE OF MAN REGARDS HIMSELF AS A DETERMINER OF VALUES HE DOES NOT REQUIRE TO BE APPROVED OF HE PASSES THE JUDGMENT WHAT IS INJURIOUS TO ME IS INJURIOUS IN ITSELF HE KNOWS THAT IT IS HE HIMSELF ONLY WHO CONFERS HONOUR ON THINGS HE IS A CREATOR OF VALUES. HE HONOURS WHATEVER HE RECOGNIZES IN HIMSELF SUCH MORALITY EQUALS SELF GLORIFICATION. THE NOBLE MAN HONOURS IN HIMSELF THE POWERFUL ONE HIM ALSO WHO HAS POWER OVER HIMSELF WHO KNOWS HOW TO SPEAK AND HOW TO KEEP SILENCE WHO TAKES PLEASURE IN SUBJECTING HIMSELF TO SEVERITY AND HARDNESS AND HAS REVERENCE FOR ALL THAT IS SEVERE AND HARD. WOTAN PLACED A HARD HEART IN MY BREAST SAYS AN OLD SCANDINAVIAN SAGA IT IS THUS RIGHTLY EXPRESSED FROM THE SOUL OF A PROUD VIKING
