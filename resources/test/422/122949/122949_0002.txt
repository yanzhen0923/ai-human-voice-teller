THE FAVOUR THE SUPER ABUNDANCE THE PROTECTION ARE THERE LACKING UNDER WHICH VARIATIONS ARE FOSTERED THE SPECIES NEEDS ITSELF AS SPECIES AS SOMETHING WHICH PRECISELY BY VIRTUE OF ITS HARDNESS ITS UNIFORMITY AND SIMPLICITY OF STRUCTURE CAN IN GENERAL PREVAIL AND MAKE ITSELF PERMANENT IN CONSTANT STRUGGLE WITH ITS NEIGHBOURS OR WITH REBELLIOUS OR REBELLION THREATENING VASSALS. THE MOST VARIED EXPERIENCE TEACHES IT WHAT ARE THE QUALITIES TO WHICH IT PRINCIPALLY OWES THE FACT THAT IT STILL EXISTS IN SPITE OF ALL GODS AND MEN AND HAS HITHERTO BEEN VICTORIOUS THESE QUALITIES IT CALLS VIRTUES AND THESE VIRTUES ALONE IT DEVELOPS TO MATURITY. IT DOES SO WITH SEVERITY INDEED IT DESIRES SEVERITY EVERY ARISTOCRATIC MORALITY IS INTOLERANT IN THE EDUCATION OF YOUTH IN THE CONTROL OF WOMEN IN THE MARRIAGE CUSTOMS IN THE RELATIONS OF OLD AND YOUNG IN THE PENAL LAWS WHICH HAVE AN EYE ONLY FOR THE DEGENERATING IT COUNTS INTOLERANCE ITSELF AMONG THE VIRTUES UNDER THE NAME OF JUSTICE. FINALLY HOWEVER A HAPPY STATE OF THINGS RESULTS THE ENORMOUS TENSION IS RELAXED THERE ARE PERHAPS NO MORE ENEMIES AMONG THE NEIGHBOURING PEOPLES AND THE MEANS OF LIFE EVEN OF THE ENJOYMENT OF LIFE ARE PRESENT IN SUPERABUNDANCE. WITH ONE STROKE THE BOND AND CONSTRAINT OF THE OLD DISCIPLINE SEVERS IT IS NO LONGER REGARDED AS NECESSARY AS A CONDITION OF EXISTENCE IF IT WOULD CONTINUE IT CAN ONLY DO SO AS A FORM OF LUXURY AS AN ARCHAIZING TASTE. VARIATIONS WHETHER THEY BE DEVIATIONS INTO THE HIGHER FINER AND RARER OR DETERIORATIONS AND MONSTROSITIES APPEAR SUDDENLY ON THE SCENE IN THE GREATEST EXUBERANCE AND SPLENDOUR THE INDIVIDUAL DARES TO BE INDIVIDUAL AND DETACH HIMSELF. AT THIS TURNING POINT OF HISTORY THERE MANIFEST THEMSELVES SIDE BY SIDE AND OFTEN MIXED AND ENTANGLED TOGETHER A MAGNIFICENT MANIFOLD VIRGIN FOREST LIKE UP GROWTH AND UP STRIVING A KIND OF TROPICAL TEMPO IN THE RIVALRY OF GROWTH AND AN EXTRAORDINARY DECAY AND SELF DESTRUCTION OWING TO THE SAVAGELY OPPOSING AND SEEMINGLY EXPLODING EGOISMS WHICH STRIVE WITH ONE ANOTHER FOR SUN AND LIGHT AND CAN NO LONGER ASSIGN ANY LIMIT RESTRAINT OR FORBEARANCE FOR THEMSELVES BY MEANS OF THE HITHERTO EXISTING MORALITY. NOTHING BUT NEW WHYS NOTHING BUT NEW HOWS NO COMMON FORMULAS ANY LONGER MISUNDERSTANDING AND DISREGARD IN LEAGUE WITH EACH OTHER DECAY DETERIORATION AND THE LOFTIEST DESIRES FRIGHTFULLY ENTANGLED THE GENIUS OF THE RACE OVERFLOWING FROM ALL THE CORNUCOPIAS OF GOOD AND BAD A PORTENTOUS SIMULTANEOUSNESS OF SPRING AND AUTUMN FULL OF NEW CHARMS AND MYSTERIES PECULIAR TO THE FRESH STILL INEXHAUSTED STILL UNWEARIED CORRUPTION. DANGER IS AGAIN PRESENT THE MOTHER OF MORALITY GREAT DANGER THIS TIME SHIFTED INTO THE INDIVIDUAL INTO THE NEIGHBOUR AND FRIEND INTO THE STREET INTO THEIR OWN CHILD INTO THEIR OWN HEART INTO ALL THE MOST PERSONAL AND SECRET RECESSES OF THEIR DESIRES AND VOLITIONS. WHAT WILL THE MORAL PHILOSOPHERS WHO APPEAR AT THIS TIME HAVE TO PREACH. THEY DISCOVER THESE SHARP ONLOOKERS AND LOAFERS THAT THE END IS QUICKLY APPROACHING THAT EVERYTHING AROUND THEM DECAYS AND PRODUCES DECAY THAT NOTHING WILL ENDURE UNTIL THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW EXCEPT ONE SPECIES OF MAN THE INCURABLY MEDIOCRE. THIS IS THE PROBLEM OF RACE. IN OUR VERY DEMOCRATIC OR RATHER VERY PLEBEIAN AGE EDUCATION AND CULTURE MUST BE ESSENTIALLY THE ART OF DECEIVING DECEIVING WITH REGARD TO ORIGIN WITH REGARD TO THE INHERITED PLEBEIANISM IN BODY AND SOUL. BE NATURAL SHOW YOURSELVES AS YOU ARE
