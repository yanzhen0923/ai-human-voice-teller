NEXT TO IT IS COPPA'S BUT IT IS NO LONGER RUN BY COPPA. IN THIS SAME DISTRICT IS THE MINT IN COMMERCIAL STREET BETWEEN MONTGOMERY AND KEARNY STREETS. IT HAS CHANGED FROM WHAT IT WAS IN THE OLD DAYS BUT IS STILL AN EXCELLENT PLACE TO DINE. THE COOKING IS GOOD AND THE VARIETY WHAT THE MARKET AFFORDS. IN WASHINGTON STREET JUST OFF COLUMBUS AVENUE IS BONINI'S BARN MAKING GREAT PRETENSE THROUGH AN UNIQUE IDEA. SO FAR AS THE RESTAURANT IS CONCERNED THE FOOD IS A LITTLE BELOW THE AVERAGE OF ITALIAN RESTAURANTS. TABLES AND CHAIRS ARE CRUDE IN THE EXTREME AND OLD TIME LANTERNS ARE USED FOR LIGHTING. IT IS AN IDEA THAT IS WORTH WHILE BUT UNFORTUNATELY THE PROPRIETORS DEPEND TOO MUCH ON THE DECORATIVE FEATURE AND TOO LITTLE ON THE FOOD AND HOW THEY SERVE IT. THE FLY TRAP AND CHARLIE'S FASHION THE FIRST IN SUTTER STREET NEAR KEARNY AND THE OTHER IN MARKET NEAR SUTTER SERVE WELL COOKED FOODS ESPECIALLY SOUP SALADS AND FISH. OF COURSE THESE ARE NOT THE ENTIRE MENUS BUT OF ALL THE WELL PREPARED DISHES THESE ARE THEIR BEST. FELIX MENTIONED BEFORE ALSO MAKES A SPECIALTY OF HIS FAMILY SOUP WHICH IS EXCELLENT. BOTH SERVE GOOD SPANISH DINNERS AT REASONABLE PRICES. UNDER THE MONADNOCK BUILDING IN MARKET STREET NEAR THIRD IS JULE'S WELL LIKED AND WELL PATRONIZED BECAUSE OF ITS GOOD COOKING AND GOOD SERVICE. JULE IS ONE OF THE NOTED RESTAURATEURS OF THE CITY HAVING ATTAINED HIGH CELEBRITY BEFORE THE FIRE. HIS PRICES ARE MODERATE AND HIS COOKING AND VIANDS OF THE BEST AND WILL SATISFY THE MOST CRITICAL OF THE GOURMETS. AT THE CORNER OF MARKET AND EDDY STREETS IS THE ODEON DOWN IN A BASEMENT WITH DECORATIONS OF MOST GARISH ORDER. THERE IS A GOOD CHEF AND THE PLACE HAS QUITE A VOGUE AMONG LOVERS OF GOOD THINGS TO EAT. OR YOU MAY ORDER ANYTHING IN THE MARKET AND YOU WILL FIND IT COOKED THE BEST WAY. ONE OF THE SPECIALTIES OF JACK'S IS FISH FOR WHICH THE RESTAURANT IS NOTED. IT IS ALWAYS STRICTLY FRESH AND BOOKED TO SUIT THE MOST FASTIDIOUS TASTE. ALL YOU CAN SEE FROM THE STREET AS YOU PASS AROUND THE CORNER FROM MARKET IS A SIGN AND SOME STAIRS LEADING DOWN INTO A BASEMENT BUT DO NOT DRAW BACK JUST BECAUSE IT IS A BASEMENT RESTAURANT FOR IF YOU DO YOU WILL MISS ONE OF THE VERY FEW REAL BOHEMIAN RESTAURANTS OF SAN FRANCISCO. POSSIBLY OUR POINT OF VIEW WILL NOT COINCIDE WITH THAT OF OTHERS BUT WHILE THERE ARE DOZENS OF OTHER BOHEMIAN RESTAURANTS THERE IS BUT ONE HEIDELBERG INN. HERE IS ABSOLUTE FREEDOM FROM IRKSOME CONVENTIONALITY OF OTHER PEOPLE AND NONE OF THE NEAR BOHEMIANISM OF SO MANY PLACES CLAIMING THE TITLE. AT THE HEIDELBERG INN ONE NEED NEVER FEAR OBTRUSIVENESS ON THE PART OF OTHER VISITORS FOR HERE EVERYBODY ATTENDS STRICTLY TO HIS OR HER OWN PARTY ENJOYING A CAMARADERIE THAT HAS ALL THE GENUINE WHOLE SOULED COMPANIONSHIP FOUND ONLY WHERE GERMAN FAMILIES ARE ACCUSTOMED TO CONGREGATE TO SEEK RELAXATION FROM THE TOIL AND WORRY OF THE DAY. HERE YOU DO NOT FIND OBTRUSIVE WAITERS BRUSHING IMAGINARY CRUMBS FROM YOUR CHAIR WITH OBSEQUIOUS HAND NOR OVER ZEALOUS STEWARDS SOLICITOUS OF YOUR FOOD'S QUALITY. IT IS ALL PERFECT BECAUSE IT IS MADE PERFECT BY GOOD MANAGEMENT. HERE ARE GERMAN FAMILIES FROM GROSSFADER AND GROSSMUTTER DOWN TO THE NEWEST GRANDCHILD SITTING AND ENJOYING THEIR BEER AND LISTENING TO SUCH MUSIC AS CAN BE HEARD NOWHERE ELSE IN SAN FRANCISCO AS THEY EAT THEIR SANDWICHES OF LIMBURGER OR MORE DAINTY DISHES ACCORDING TO THEIR TASTES. ONE CAN ALMOST IMAGINE HIMSELF IN ONE OF THE FAMOUS RATHSKELLERS OF OLD HEIDELBERG NOT AT THE SCHLOSS OF COURSE FOR HERE YOU CANNOT LOOK DOWN ON THE WEISER AS IT FLOWS BENEATH THE WINDOWS OF THE GREAT WINE STUBE ON THE HILL. BUT YOU HAVE THE REAL ATMOSPHERE AND THIS IS ENHANCED BY THE MOTTOES IN DECORATION AND THE FLAGONS STEMS AND PLAQUES THAT ADORN THE PILLARS AS WELL AS TYPICAL GERMAN ENVIRONMENT
