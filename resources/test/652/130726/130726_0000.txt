SAN FRANCISCO'S CARE FREE SPIRIT WAS FULLY EXEMPLIFIED BEFORE THE ASHES OF THE GREAT FIRE OF NINETEEN O SIX WERE COLD. ON EVERY HAND ONE COULD FIND LITTLE EATING PLACES ESTABLISHED IN THE STREETS SOME MADE OF ABANDONED BOXES OTHERS OF DEBRIS FROM THE BURNED BUILDINGS AND SOME IN VACANT BASEMENTS AND LITTLE STORE ROOMS WHILE A FEW ENTERPRISING INDIVIDUALS IMPROVISED WHEELED DINING ROOMS AND WENT FROM ONE PART OF THE CITY TO ANOTHER SERVING MEALS. THE VEIN OF HUMOR OF IRREPRESSIBLE EFFERVESCENCE OF SPIRIT BORN OF BOHEMIANISM GAVE TO THESE EATING PLACES HIGH SOUNDING NAMES AND MANY WERE COVERED WITH WITTY SIGNS WHICH LAUGHED IN THE FACE OF FATE. THIS WAS ON THE CORNER OF FILLMORE AND ELLIS AND HAD LARGE PATRONAGE IT BEING CROWDED NIGHTLY WITH MEN AND WOMEN WHO SEEMED TO FORGET THAT SAN FRANCISCO HAD BEEN DESTROYED. THOMPSON OPENED A LARGE RESTAURANT IN O'FARRELL STREET JUST ABOVE FILLMORE AND FOR TWO YEARS OR MORE DID A THRIVING BUSINESS HIS PLACE BEING NOTED FOR ITS GOOD COOKING AND ITS SPLENDID SERVICE. ONE OF HIS WAITERS PHIL TYSON WAS ONE OF THE EARLIER ONES TO GO BACK INTO THE BURNED DISTRICT TO BEGIN BUSINESS AND HE OPENED A RESTAURANT CALLED THE DEL MONTE IN POWELL STREET NEAR MARKET BUT IT WAS TOO EARLY FOR SUCCESS AND CLOSED AFTER A SHORT CAREER. THOMPSON ENLISTED OTHERS TO JOIN WITH HIM IN OPENING A MAGNIFICENT PLACE UNDER THE NEW FLOOD BUILDING AT THE CORNER OF POWELL AND MARKET STREET BUT THROUGH FAULTY UNDERSTANDING OF FINANCIAL POWER THOMPSON WAS COMPELLED TO GIVE UP HIS INTEREST AND THE PLACE AFTERWARD CLOSED. IT HAS SINCE BEEN REOPENED UNDER THE NAME OF THE PORTOLA LOUVRE WHERE NOW CROWDS ASSEMBLE NIGHTLY TO LISTEN TO MUSIC AND WITNESS CABARET PERFORMANCES. HERE AS WELL AS IN A NUMBER OF OTHER PLACES ONE CAN WELL APPRECIATE THE COLLOQUIAL DEFINITION OF CABARET. THAT WHICH TAKES THE REST OUT OF RESTAURANT AND PUTS THE DIN IN DINNER. IF ONE LIKES NOISE AND DISTRACTION WHILE EATING SUCH PLACES ARE GOOD TO PATRONIZE. ACROSS THE STREET FROM THE PORTOLA LOUVRE AT FIFTEEN POWELL STREET IS THE MODERNIZED TECHAU TAVERN NOW KNOWN AS TECHAU'S. HERE THERE IS ALWAYS GOOD MUSIC AND FOOD WELL COOKED AND WELL SERVED AND ALWAYS A LIVELY CROWD DURING THE LUNCHEON DINNER AND AFTER THEATRE HOURS THE ROOM IS NOT LARGE BUT ITS DIMENSIONS ARE GREATLY MAGNIFIED OWING TO THE COVERING OF MIRRORS WHICH LINE THE WALLS. THIS GARISH DISPLAY OF MIRRORS AND ELABORATE DECORATION OF CEILING AND PILLARS GIVES IT THE APPEARANCE OF THE ABODE OF SATURNALIA BUT DECORUM IS THE RULE AMONG THE PATRONS. JOHN TAIT IS THE PRESIDING SPIRIT HERE HE HAVING MADE REPUTATION AS CLUB MANAGER AND THEN AS MANAGER OF THE CLIFF HOUSE. ONE OF THE PARTNERS HERE WAS CARL ZINKAND WHO RAN THE OLD ZINKAND'S BEFORE THE FIRE. WHILE THESE THREE RESTAURANTS ARE OF SIMILAR TYPE NEITHER HAS THE PRE FIRE ATMOSPHERE THEY ARE LIVELY ALWAYS WITH MUSIC AND GAY THRONGS AND SERVE GOOD FOOD. THE POODLE DOG HAS A HOTEL ATTACHMENT WHERE ONE MAY GET ROOMS OR FULL APARTMENTS. IF YOU KNOW HOW TO ORDER AND DO NOT CARE TO COUNT THE COST WHEN YOU ORDER PROBABLY THE BEST DINNER AT THESE RESTAURANTS CAN BE HAD AT EITHER BLANCO'S OR THE POODLE DOG. THE CUISINE IS OF THE BEST AND THE CHEFS RANK AT THE TOP OF THEIR ART. PRICES ARE HIGHER THAN AT THE OTHER RESTAURANTS MENTIONED BUT ONE CERTAINLY GETS THE BEST THERE IS PREPARED IN THE BEST WAY. BUT THE SAME FOOD PREPARED EQUALLY WELL IS TO BE FOUND IN A NUMBER OF LESS PRETENTIOUS PLACES. AT THE TWO MENTIONED ONE PAYS FOR THE SURROUNDINGS AS WELL AS FOR THE FOOD AND SOMETIMES THIS IS WORTH PAYING FOR. THE RESTAURANTS OF THE PRESENT DAY THAT APPROACH NEAREST THE OLD BOHEMIAN RESTAURANTS OF PRE FIRE DAYS OF THE FRENCH CLASS ARE JACK'S IN SACRAMENTO STREET BETWEEN MONTGOMERY AND KEARNY FELIX IN MONTGOMERY STREET BETWEEN CLAY AND WASHINGTON AND THE POODLE DOG BERGEZ FRANKS IN BUSH STREET BETWEEN KEARNY AND GRANT AVENUE. IN EITHER OF THESE RESTAURANTS YOU WILL BE SERVED WITH THE BEST THE MARKET AFFORDS COOKED THE RIGHT WAY. IN CLAY STREET OPPOSITE THE CALIFORNIA MARKET IS THE NEW FRANK'S ONE OF THE BEST OF THE ITALIAN RESTAURANTS AND MUCH PATRONIZED BY ITALIAN MERCHANTS
