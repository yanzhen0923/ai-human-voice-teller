IT IS WHEN THE MARTIAL STRAINS OF DE WACHT AM RHEIN ARE HEARD FROM THE ORCHESTRA WHICH OF ITSELF IS AN INSTITUTION THAT THE TRUE CAMARADERIE OF THE PLACE IS APPRECIATED FOR THEN GUESTS WAITERS BARKEEPERS AND EVEN THE EAGLE EYED GRAY HAIRED MANAGER JOIN IN THE SWELLING CHORUS AND YOU CAN WELL UNDERSTAND WHY GERMAN SOLDIERS ARE INSPIRED TO MARCH TO VICTORY WHEN THEY HEAR THESE STIRRING CHORDS. BUT THERE IS OTHER MUSIC SOMETIMES NEITHER INSPIRING NOR BEAUTIFUL WHEN HEARD IN A GERMAN RATHSKELLER THE MUSIC OF RAG TIME. IF THERE IS ANYTHING FUNNIER THAN A GERMAN ORCHESTRA TRYING TO PLAY RAG TIME MUSIC WE HAVE NEVER HEARD IT. IT IS UNCONSCIOUS HUMOR ON PART OF THE ORCHESTRA CONSEQUENTLY IS ALL THE MORE EXCRUCIATING. BUT IF YOU REALLY LOVE GOOD MUSIC MUSIC THAT HAS MELODY AND RHYTHM AND SOOTHING CADENCES GO TO THE HEIDELBERG INN AND LISTEN TO THE CONCERT WHICH IS A FEATURE OF THE PLACE EVERY EVENING. AND WHILE YOU ARE LISTENING TO THE MUSIC YOU CAN ENJOY SUCH FOOD AS IS TO BE FOUND NOWHERE ELSE IN SAN FRANCISCO FOR IT IS DISTINCTLY HEIDELBERGIAN. WE FINALLY GOT HIM TO SELECT THE ONE PRIZED ABOVE ALL OTHERS AND THIS IS WHAT CHEF SCHEILER GAVE US. TAKE FOUR POUNDS OF CLEAR BEEF FROM EITHER THE SHOULDER OR RUMP AND PICKLE IT FOR TWO DAYS IN ONE HALF GALLON OF CLARET AND ONE HALF GALLON OF GOOD WINE VINEGAR NOT CIDER. TO THE PICKLE ADD TWO LARGE ONIONS CUT IN QUARTERS TWO FRESH CARROTS AND ABOUT ONE OUNCE OF MIXED WHOLE ALLSPICE BLACK PEPPERS CLOVES AND BAY LEAVES. WHEN READY FOR COOKING TAKE THE MEAT OUT OF THE BRINE AND PUT IN A ROASTING PAN. PUT IN THE OVEN AND BROWN TO A GOLDEN COLOR. THEN TAKE IT OUT OF THE ROASTING PAN AND PUT IT INTO A CASSEROLE AFTER SPRINKLING IT WITH TWO OUNCES OF FLOUR. PUT INTO THE OVEN AGAIN AND COOK FOR HALF AN HOUR BASTING FREQUENTLY WITH THE ORIGINAL BRINE. WHEN DONE TAKE THE MEAT OUT OF THE SAUCE. STRAIN THE SAUCE THROUGH A FINE COLLANDER AND ADD A FEW RAISINS A PIECE OF HONEY CAKE OR GINGER SNAPS AND THE MEAT OF ONE FRESH TOMATO. SEASON WITH SALT AND PEPPER AND A LITTLE SUGAR TO TASTE. SLICE AND SERVE WITH THE SAUCE OVER IT. FOR THOSE WHO LIKE GERMAN DISHES AND GERMAN COOKING IT IS NOT NECESSARY TO CONFINE YOURSELF TO THE HEIDELBERG INN FOR BOTH THE HOF BRAU IN MARKET JUST ABOVE FOURTH STREET AND THE GERMAN HOUSE RATHSKELLER AT TURK AND POLK STREETS ARE GOOD PLACES WHERE YOU CAN GET WHAT YOU WANT. THE HOF BRAU HOWEVER IS LESS DISTINCTIVELY GERMAN AS THE GREATER NUMBER OF ITS PATRONS ARE AMERICANS. THE SPECIALTY OF THE HOF BRAU IS ABALONE'S AND THEY HAVE AS A FEATURE THIS SHELL FISH COOKED IN SEVERAL WAYS. THEY ALSO HAVE AS THE CHEF IN CHARGE OF THE ABALONE DISHES HERBERT FORMERLY CHEF FOR ONE OF THE YACHT CLUBS OF THE COAST WHO CLAIMS TO HAVE THE ONLY PROPER RECIPE FOR MAKING ABALONE'S TENDER. UNDER ORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCES THE ABALONE IS TOUGH AND UNPALATABLE BUT AFTER THE DEFT MANIPULATION OF HERBERT THEY ARE TENDER AND MAKE A FINE DISH EITHER FRIED AS CHOWDER OR A LA NEWBERG. IN ADDITION TO ABALONE'S THE HOF BRAU MAKES A SPECIALTY OF LITTLE OREGON CRAWFISH. WHILE THERE IS A DISTINCTIVE GERMAN ATMOSPHERE AT THE RATHSKELLER OF THE GERMAN HOUSE THE PLACE IS TOO FAR OUT TO GATHER SUCH NUMBERS AS CONGREGATE AT EITHER THE HEIDELBERG OR THE HOF BRAU BUT ONE CAN GET THE BEST OF GERMAN COOKING HERE AND SPLENDID SERVICE AND FOR A QUIET LITTLE DUTCH SUPPER WE KNOW OF NO PLACE THAT WILL ACCOMMODATE YOU BETTER THAN THE RATHSKELLER
