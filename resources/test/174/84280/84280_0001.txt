IT SIGNIFIES LESS THAT SHE SHOULD HAVE FLUNG OUT OF LIFE WHEN IT SEEMED THAT HER LIVING COULD ONLY HAVE MEANT DISASTER TO HERSELF AND TO ALL SHE LOVED THAN THAT ALL HER LIFE SHOULD HAVE BEEN HAMPERED AND RESTRICTED. IT WAS THAT IDEA OF WASTE THAT DOMINATED MY MIND IN A STRANGE INTERVIEW I HAD WITH JUSTIN. FOR IT BECAME NECESSARY FOR ME TO SEE JUSTIN IN ORDER THAT WE SHOULD STAMP OUT THE WHISPERS AGAINST HER THAT FOLLOWED HER DEATH. HE HAD MADE IT SEEM AN ACCIDENTAL DEATH DUE TO AN OVERDOSE OF THE NARCOTIC SHE EMPLOYED BUT HE HAD NOT BEEN ABLE TO OBLITERATE ALTOGETHER THE BEGINNINGS OF HIS DIVORCE PROCEEDINGS. THERE HAD BEEN TALK ON THE PART OF CLERKS AND POSSIBLE WITNESSES. BUT OF ALL THAT I NEED NOT TELL YOU HERE WHAT MATTERS IS THAT JUSTIN AND I COULD MEET WITHOUT HATRED OR VIOLENCE. I MET A JUSTIN GREY HAIRED AND IT SEEMED TO ME PHYSICALLY SHRUNKEN MORE THAN EVER SLOW SPEAKING WITH HIS HABIT OF ATTENTIVE SILENCES MORE MARKED AND THAT DARK SCAR SPREAD BEYOND HIS BROWS. WE HAD COME TO OUR PARTING WE HAD DONE OUR BUSINESS WITH AN AFFECTATION OF EMOTIONAL ALOOFNESS AND THEN SUDDENLY HE GRIPPED ME BY THE ARM. STRATTON HE SAID WE TWO WE KILLED HER. WE TORE HER TO PIECES BETWEEN US. I MADE NO ANSWER TO THIS OUTBREAK. WE TORE HER TO PIECES HE REPEATED. IT'S SO DAMNED SILLY. ONE GETS ANGRY LIKE AN ANIMAL. I BECAME GROTESQUELY ANXIOUS TO ASSURE HIM THAT INDEED SHE AND I HAD BEEN AS THEY SAY INNOCENT THROUGHOUT OUR LAST DAY TOGETHER. YOU WERE WRONG IN ALL THAT I SAID SHE KEPT HER FAITH WITH YOU. WE NEVER PLANNED TO MEET AND WHEN WE MET. IF WE HAD BEEN BROTHER AND SISTER INDEED THERE WAS NOTHING. I SUPPOSE HE SAID I OUGHT TO BE GLAD OF THAT. BUT NOW IT DOESN'T SEEM TO MATTER VERY MUCH. AND IT IS UPON THIS EFFECT OF SWEET AND BEAUTIFUL POSSIBILITIES CAUGHT IN THE NET OF ANIMAL JEALOUSIES AND THOUGHTLESS MOTIVES AND ANCIENT RIGID INSTITUTIONS THAT I WOULD END THIS WRITING. IN MARY IT SEEMS TO ME I FOUND BOTH WOMANHOOD AND FELLOWSHIP I FOUND WHAT MANY HAVE DREAMT OF LOVE AND FRIENDSHIP FREELY GIVEN AND I COULD DO NOTHING BUT CLUTCH AT HER TO MAKE HER MY POSSESSION. I WOULD NOT PERMIT HER TO LIVE EXCEPT AS A PART OF MY LIFE. I SEE HER NOW AND UNDERSTAND HER BETTER THAN WHEN SHE WAS ALIVE I RECALL THINGS THAT SHE SAID AND WROTE AND IT IS CLEAR TO ME CLEARER PERHAPS THAN IT EVER WAS TO HER THAT SHE WITH HER RESENTMENT AT BEING IN ANY SENSE PROPERTY HER SELF RELIANT THOUGHT HER INDEPENDENCE OF STANDARD WAS THE VERY PROTOTYPE OF THAT SISTER LOVER WHO MUST REPLACE THE SEDUCTIVE AND ABJECT WOMANHOOD OWNED MASTERED AND DECEIVING WHO WASTE THE WORLD TO DAY. AND SHE WAS OWNED SHE WAS MASTERED SHE WAS FORCED INTO CONCEALMENT. WHAT ALTERNATIVE WAS THERE FOR HER. WHAT ALTERNATIVE IS THERE FOR ANY WOMAN. SHE MIGHT PERHAPS HAVE KEPT HER FREEDOM BY SOME ILL PAID WORK AND AT THE PRICE OF EVERY OTHER IMPULSE IN HER SWIFT AND EAGER NATURE. SHE MIGHT HAVE BECOME ONE OF THOSE POOR NEUTERS AN INDEPENDENT WOMAN LIFE WAS MADE IMPOSSIBLE FOR HER AND SHE WAS FORCED TO DIE ACCORDING TO THE FATE OF ALL UNTIMELY THINGS
