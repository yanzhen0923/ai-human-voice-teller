SHE WAS DESTROYED NOT MERELY BY THE UNCONSIDERED UNDISCIPLINED PASSIONS OF HER HUSBAND AND HER LOVER BUT BY THE VAST TRADITION THAT SUSTAINS AND ENFORCES THE SUBJUGATION OF HER SEX. WHAT I HAD FROM HER AND WHAT SHE WAS IS BUT A MERE INTIMATION OF ALL THAT SHE AND I MIGHT HAVE MADE OF EACH OTHER AND THE WORLD. AND PERHAPS IN THIS STORY I HAVE SAID ENOUGH FOR YOU TO UNDERSTAND WHY MARY HAS IDENTIFIED HERSELF WITH SOMETHING WORLD WIDE HAS ADDED TO HERSELF A SYMBOLICAL VALUE AND WHY IT IS I FIND IN THE WHOLE CROWDED SPECTACLE OF MANKIND A QUALITY THAT IS ALSO HERS A SENSE OF FINE THINGS ENTANGLED AND STIFLED AND UNABLE TO FREE THEMSELVES FROM THE ANCIENT LIMITING JEALOUSIES WHICH LAW AND CUSTOM EMBODY. FOR I KNOW THAT A GROWING MULTITUDE OF MEN AND WOMEN OUTWEAR THE ANCIENT WAYS. THE BLOOD STAINED ORGANIZED JEALOUSIES OF RELIGIOUS INTOLERANCE THE DELUSIONS OF NATIONALITY AND CULT AND RACE THAT BLACK HATRED WHICH SIMPLE PEOPLE AND YOUNG PEOPLE AND COMMON PEOPLE CHERISH AGAINST ALL THAT IS NOT IN THE LIKENESS OF THEMSELVES CEASE TO BE THE UNDISPUTED RULING FORCES OF OUR COLLECTIVE LIFE. WE WANT TO EMANCIPATE OUR LIVES FROM THIS SLAVERY AND THESE STUPIDITIES FROM DULL HATREDS AND SUSPICION. THE RIPENING MIND OF OUR RACE TIRES OF THESE BOORISH AND BRUTISH AND CHILDISH THINGS. A SPIRIT THAT IS LIKE HERS ARISES AND INCREASES IN HUMAN AFFAIRS A SPIRIT THAT DEMANDS FREEDOM AND GRACIOUS LIVING AS OUR INHERITANCE TOO LONG DEFERRED AND I WHO LOVED HER SO BLINDLY AND NARROWLY NOW LOVE HER SPIRIT WITH A DAWNING UNDERSTANDING. I WILL NOT BE CONTENT WITH THAT COMPROMISE OF JEALOUSIES WHICH IS THE ESTABLISHED LIFE OF HUMANITY TO DAY
