CHAPTER THREE TWO MISFORTUNES MAKE ONE PIECE OF GOOD FORTUNE. ON THE FOLLOWING MORNING AT DAYBREAK JEAN VALJEAN WAS STILL BY COSETTE'S BEDSIDE HE WATCHED THERE MOTIONLESS WAITING FOR HER TO WAKE. SOME NEW THING HAD COME INTO HIS SOUL. JEAN VALJEAN HAD NEVER LOVED ANYTHING FOR TWENTY FIVE YEARS HE HAD BEEN ALONE IN THE WORLD. HE HAD NEVER BEEN FATHER LOVER HUSBAND FRIEND. IN THE PRISON HE HAD BEEN VICIOUS GLOOMY CHASTE IGNORANT AND SHY. THE HEART OF THAT EX CONVICT WAS FULL OF VIRGINITY. HIS SISTER AND HIS SISTER'S CHILDREN HAD LEFT HIM ONLY A VAGUE AND FAR OFF MEMORY WHICH HAD FINALLY ALMOST COMPLETELY VANISHED HE HAD MADE EVERY EFFORT TO FIND THEM AND NOT HAVING BEEN ABLE TO FIND THEM HE HAD FORGOTTEN THEM. HUMAN NATURE IS MADE THUS THE OTHER TENDER EMOTIONS OF HIS YOUTH IF HE HAD EVER HAD ANY HAD FALLEN INTO AN ABYSS. WHEN HE SAW COSETTE WHEN HE HAD TAKEN POSSESSION OF HER CARRIED HER OFF AND DELIVERED HER HE FELT HIS HEART MOVED WITHIN HIM. ALL THE PASSION AND AFFECTION WITHIN HIM AWOKE AND RUSHED TOWARDS THAT CHILD. HE APPROACHED THE BED WHERE SHE LAY SLEEPING AND TREMBLED WITH JOY. HE SUFFERED ALL THE PANGS OF A MOTHER AND HE KNEW NOT WHAT IT MEANT FOR THAT GREAT AND SINGULAR MOVEMENT OF A HEART WHICH BEGINS TO LOVE IS A VERY OBSCURE AND A VERY SWEET THING. POOR OLD MAN WITH A PERFECTLY NEW HEART. ONLY AS HE WAS FIVE AND FIFTY AND COSETTE EIGHT YEARS OF AGE ALL THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN LOVE IN THE WHOLE COURSE OF HIS LIFE FLOWED TOGETHER INTO A SORT OF INEFFABLE LIGHT. IT WAS THE SECOND WHITE APPARITION WHICH HE HAD ENCOUNTERED. THE BISHOP HAD CAUSED THE DAWN OF VIRTUE TO RISE ON HIS HORIZON COSETTE CAUSED THE DAWN OF LOVE TO RISE. THE EARLY DAYS PASSED IN THIS DAZZLED STATE. COSETTE ON HER SIDE HAD ALSO UNKNOWN TO HERSELF BECOME ANOTHER BEING POOR LITTLE THING. SHE WAS SO LITTLE WHEN HER MOTHER LEFT HER THAT SHE NO LONGER REMEMBERED HER. LIKE ALL CHILDREN WHO RESEMBLE YOUNG SHOOTS OF THE VINE WHICH CLING TO EVERYTHING SHE HAD TRIED TO LOVE SHE HAD NOT SUCCEEDED. SHE HAD LOVED THE DOG AND HE HAD DIED AFTER WHICH NOTHING AND NOBODY WOULD HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH HER. IT IS A SAD THING TO SAY AND WE HAVE ALREADY INTIMATED IT THAT AT EIGHT YEARS OF AGE HER HEART WAS COLD. IT WAS NOT HER FAULT IT WAS NOT THE FACULTY OF LOVING THAT SHE LACKED ALAS IT WAS THE POSSIBILITY. THUS FROM THE VERY FIRST DAY ALL HER SENTIENT AND THINKING POWERS LOVED THIS KIND MAN. SHE FELT THAT WHICH SHE HAD NEVER FELT BEFORE A SENSATION OF EXPANSION. THE MAN NO LONGER PRODUCED ON HER THE EFFECT OF BEING OLD OR POOR SHE THOUGHT JEAN VALJEAN HANDSOME JUST AS SHE THOUGHT THE HOVEL PRETTY. THESE ARE THE EFFECTS OF THE DAWN OF CHILDHOOD OF JOY. THE NOVELTY OF THE EARTH AND OF LIFE COUNTS FOR SOMETHING HERE. NOTHING IS SO CHARMING AS THE COLORING REFLECTION OF HAPPINESS ON A GARRET. WE ALL HAVE IN OUR PAST A DELIGHTFUL GARRET
