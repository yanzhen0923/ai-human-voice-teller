NATURE A DIFFERENCE OF FIFTY YEARS HAD SET A PROFOUND GULF BETWEEN JEAN VALJEAN AND COSETTE DESTINY FILLED IN THIS GULF. DESTINY SUDDENLY UNITED AND WEDDED WITH ITS IRRESISTIBLE POWER THESE TWO UPROOTED EXISTENCES DIFFERING IN AGE ALIKE IN SORROW. ONE IN FACT COMPLETED THE OTHER. COSETTE'S INSTINCT SOUGHT A FATHER AS JEAN VALJEAN'S INSTINCT SOUGHT A CHILD. TO MEET WAS TO FIND EACH OTHER. AT THE MYSTERIOUS MOMENT WHEN THEIR HANDS TOUCHED THEY WERE WELDED TOGETHER. WHEN THESE TWO SOULS PERCEIVED EACH OTHER THEY RECOGNIZED EACH OTHER AS NECESSARY TO EACH OTHER AND EMBRACED EACH OTHER CLOSELY. MOREOVER JEAN VALJEAN HAD CHOSEN HIS REFUGE WELL. THERE HE SEEMED PERFECTLY SECURE. THE CHAMBER WITH A DRESSING ROOM WHICH HE OCCUPIED WITH COSETTE WAS THE ONE WHOSE WINDOW OPENED ON THE BOULEVARD. THIS BEING THE ONLY WINDOW IN THE HOUSE NO NEIGHBORS GLANCES WERE TO BE FEARED FROM ACROSS THE WAY OR AT THE SIDE. IT WAS THIS OLD WOMAN ORNAMENTED WITH THE NAME OF THE PRINCIPAL LODGER AND IN REALITY INTRUSTED WITH THE FUNCTIONS OF PORTRESS WHO HAD LET HIM THE LODGING ON CHRISTMAS EVE. HE HAD REPRESENTED HIMSELF TO HER AS A GENTLEMAN OF MEANS WHO HAD BEEN RUINED BY SPANISH BONDS WHO WAS COMING THERE TO LIVE WITH HIS LITTLE DAUGHTER. HE HAD PAID HER SIX MONTHS IN ADVANCE AND HAD COMMISSIONED THE OLD WOMAN TO FURNISH THE CHAMBER AND DRESSING ROOM AS WE HAVE SEEN. IT WAS THIS GOOD WOMAN WHO HAD LIGHTED THE FIRE IN THE STOVE AND PREPARED EVERYTHING ON THE EVENING OF THEIR ARRIVAL. WEEK FOLLOWED WEEK THESE TWO BEINGS LED A HAPPY LIFE IN THAT HOVEL. COSETTE LAUGHED CHATTERED AND SANG FROM DAYBREAK. CHILDREN HAVE THEIR MORNING SONG AS WELL AS BIRDS. IT SOMETIMES HAPPENED THAT JEAN VALJEAN CLASPED HER TINY RED HAND ALL CRACKED WITH CHILBLAINS AND KISSED IT. THE POOR CHILD WHO WAS USED TO BEING BEATEN DID NOT KNOW THE MEANING OF THIS AND RAN AWAY IN CONFUSION. AT TIMES SHE BECAME SERIOUS AND STARED AT HER LITTLE BLACK GOWN. COSETTE WAS NO LONGER IN RAGS SHE WAS IN MOURNING. SHE HAD EMERGED FROM MISERY AND SHE WAS ENTERING INTO LIFE. SOMETIMES AS HE MADE THE CHILD SPELL HE REMEMBERED THAT IT WAS WITH THE IDEA OF DOING EVIL THAT HE HAD LEARNED TO READ IN PRISON. THIS IDEA HAD ENDED IN TEACHING A CHILD TO READ. THEN THE EX CONVICT SMILED WITH THE PENSIVE SMILE OF THE ANGELS. HE FELT IN IT A PREMEDITATION FROM ON HIGH THE WILL OF SOME ONE WHO WAS NOT MAN AND HE BECAME ABSORBED IN REVERY. GOOD THOUGHTS HAVE THEIR ABYSSES AS WELL AS EVIL ONES. TO TEACH COSETTE TO READ AND TO LET HER PLAY THIS CONSTITUTED NEARLY THE WHOLE OF JEAN VALJEAN'S EXISTENCE. AND THEN HE TALKED OF HER MOTHER AND HE MADE HER PRAY. SHE CALLED HIM FATHER AND KNEW NO OTHER NAME FOR HIM. HE PASSED HOURS IN WATCHING HER DRESSING AND UNDRESSING HER DOLL AND IN LISTENING TO HER PRATTLE. LIFE HENCEFORTH APPEARED TO HIM TO BE FULL OF INTEREST MEN SEEMED TO HIM GOOD AND JUST HE NO LONGER REPROACHED ANY ONE IN THOUGHT HE SAW NO REASON WHY HE SHOULD NOT LIVE TO BE A VERY OLD MAN NOW THAT THIS CHILD LOVED HIM
