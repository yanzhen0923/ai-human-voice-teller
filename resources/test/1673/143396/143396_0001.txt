SUCH INDEED IN THE MORE ORTHODOX SYSTEM HE HAS ACQUIRED SINCE HIS RESURRECTION AND SUCH HE MUST HAVE ALWAYS POSSESSED IF IT WERE CAPABLE OF PERVADING WITHOUT RESISTANCE OR INJURY THE DENSITY OF INTERMEDIATE MATTER. DEVOID OF ITS MOST ESSENTIAL PROPERTIES IT MIGHT BE EXEMPT FROM THE ATTRIBUTES AND INFIRMITIES OF THE FLESH. A FOETUS THAT COULD INCREASE FROM AN INVISIBLE POINT TO ITS FULL MATURITY A CHILD THAT COULD ATTAIN THE STATURE OF PERFECT MANHOOD WITHOUT DERIVING ANY NOURISHMENT FROM THE ORDINARY SOURCES MIGHT CONTINUE TO EXIST WITHOUT REPAIRING A DAILY WASTE BY A DAILY SUPPLY OF EXTERNAL MATTER. JESUS MIGHT SHARE THE REPASTS OF HIS DISCIPLES WITHOUT BEING SUBJECT TO THE CALLS OF THIRST OR HUNGER AND HIS VIRGIN PURITY WAS NEVER SULLIED BY THE INVOLUNTARY STAINS OF SENSUAL CONCUPISCENCE. OF A BODY THUS SINGULARLY CONSTITUTED A QUESTION WOULD ARISE BY WHAT MEANS AND OF WHAT MATERIALS IT WAS ORIGINALLY FRAMED AND OUR SOUNDER THEOLOGY IS STARTLED BY AN ANSWER WHICH WAS NOT PECULIAR TO THE GNOSTICS THAT BOTH THE FORM AND THE SUBSTANCE PROCEEDED FROM THE DIVINE ESSENCE. IF WE DEFINE THE PLACE WE MUST DESCRIBE THE FIGURE OF THE DEITY. IN THEIR EYES JESUS OF NAZARETH WAS A MERE MORTAL THE LEGITIMATE SON OF JOSEPH AND MARY BUT HE WAS THE BEST AND WISEST OF THE HUMAN RACE SELECTED AS THE WORTHY INSTRUMENT TO RESTORE UPON EARTH THE WORSHIP OF THE TRUE AND SUPREME DEITY. WHEN HE WAS BAPTIZED IN THE JORDAN THE CHRIST THE FIRST OF THE AEONS THE SON OF GOD HIMSELF DESCENDED ON JESUS IN THE FORM OF A DOVE TO INHABIT HIS MIND AND DIRECT HIS ACTIONS DURING THE ALLOTTED PERIOD OF HIS MINISTRY. WHEN THE MESSIAH WAS DELIVERED INTO THE HANDS OF THE JEWS THE CHRIST AN IMMORTAL AND IMPASSIBLE BEING FORSOOK HIS EARTHLY TABERNACLE FLEW BACK TO THE PLEROMA OR WORLD OF SPIRITS AND LEFT THE SOLITARY JESUS TO SUFFER TO COMPLAIN AND TO EXPIRE. BUT THE JUSTICE AND GENEROSITY OF SUCH A DESERTION ARE STRONGLY QUESTIONABLE AND THE FATE OF AN INNOCENT MARTYR AT FIRST IMPELLED AND AT LENGTH ABANDONED BY HIS DIVINE COMPANION MIGHT PROVOKE THE PITY AND INDIGNATION OF THE PROFANE. THEIR MURMURS WERE VARIOUSLY SILENCED BY THE SECTARIES WHO ESPOUSED AND MODIFIED THE DOUBLE SYSTEM OF CERINTHUS. IT WAS ALLEGED THAT WHEN JESUS WAS NAILED TO THE CROSS HE WAS ENDOWED WITH A MIRACULOUS APATHY OF MIND AND BODY WHICH RENDERED HIM INSENSIBLE OF HIS APPARENT SUFFERINGS. IN THE AGE OF RELIGIOUS FREEDOM WHICH WAS DETERMINED BY THE COUNCIL OF NICE THE DIGNITY OF CHRIST WAS MEASURED BY PRIVATE JUDGMENT ACCORDING TO THE INDEFINITE RULE OF SCRIPTURE OR REASON OR TRADITION. BUT WHEN HIS PURE AND PROPER DIVINITY HAD BEEN ESTABLISHED ON THE RUINS OF ARIANISM THE FAITH OF THE CATHOLICS TREMBLED ON THE EDGE OF A PRECIPICE WHERE IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO RECEDE DANGEROUS TO STAND DREADFUL TO FALL AND THE MANIFOLD INCONVENIENCES OF THEIR CREED WERE AGGRAVATED BY THE SUBLIME CHARACTER OF THEIR THEOLOGY. THE WORTHY FRIEND OF ATHANASIUS THE WORTHY ANTAGONIST OF JULIAN HE BRAVELY WRESTLED WITH THE ARIANS AND POLYTHEISTS AND THOUGH HE AFFECTED THE RIGOR OF GEOMETRICAL DEMONSTRATION HIS COMMENTARIES REVEALED THE LITERAL AND ALLEGORICAL SENSE OF THE SCRIPTURES. HE TAUGHT THAT THE GODHEAD WAS UNITED OR MINGLED WITH THE BODY OF A MAN AND THAT THE LOGOS THE ETERNAL WISDOM SUPPLIED IN THE FLESH THE PLACE AND OFFICE OF A HUMAN SOUL. YET AS THE PROFOUND DOCTOR HAD BEEN TERRIFIED AT HIS OWN RASHNESS APOLLINARIS WAS HEARD TO MUTTER SOME FAINT ACCENTS OF EXCUSE AND EXPLANATION. HE ACQUIESCED IN THE OLD DISTINCTION OF THE GREEK PHILOSOPHERS BETWEEN THE RATIONAL AND SENSITIVE SOUL OF MAN THAT HE MIGHT RESERVE THE LOGOS FOR INTELLECTUAL FUNCTIONS AND EMPLOY THE SUBORDINATE HUMAN PRINCIPLE IN THE MEANER ACTIONS OF ANIMAL LIFE. BUT INSTEAD OF A TEMPORARY AND OCCASIONAL ALLIANCE THEY ESTABLISHED AND WE STILL EMBRACE THE SUBSTANTIAL INDISSOLUBLE AND EVERLASTING UNION OF A PERFECT GOD WITH A PERFECT MAN OF THE SECOND PERSON OF THE TRINITY WITH A REASONABLE SOUL AND HUMAN FLESH
