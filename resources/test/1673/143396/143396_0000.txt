A LAUDABLE REGARD FOR THE HONOR OF THE FIRST PROSELYTE HAS COUNTENANCED THE BELIEF THE HOPE THE WISH THAT THE EBIONITES OR AT LEAST THE NAZARENES WERE DISTINGUISHED ONLY BY THEIR OBSTINATE PERSEVERANCE IN THE PRACTICE OF THE MOSAIC RITES. THEIR CHURCHES HAVE DISAPPEARED THEIR BOOKS ARE OBLITERATED THEIR OBSCURE FREEDOM MIGHT ALLOW A LATITUDE OF FAITH AND THE SOFTNESS OF THEIR INFANT CREED WOULD BE VARIOUSLY MOULDED BY THE ZEAL OR PRUDENCE OF THREE HUNDRED YEARS. YET THE MOST CHARITABLE CRITICISM MUST REFUSE THESE SECTARIES ANY KNOWLEDGE OF THE PURE AND PROPER DIVINITY OF CHRIST. HIS PROGRESS FROM INFANCY TO YOUTH AND MANHOOD WAS MARKED BY A REGULAR INCREASE IN STATURE AND WISDOM AND AFTER A PAINFUL AGONY OF MIND AND BODY HE EXPIRED ON THE CROSS. HE LIVED AND DIED FOR THE SERVICE OF MANKIND BUT THE LIFE AND DEATH OF SOCRATES HAD LIKEWISE BEEN DEVOTED TO THE CAUSE OF RELIGION AND JUSTICE AND ALTHOUGH THE STOIC OR THE HERO MAY DISDAIN THE HUMBLE VIRTUES OF JESUS THE TEARS WHICH HE SHED OVER HIS FRIEND AND COUNTRY MAY BE ESTEEMED THE PUREST EVIDENCE OF HIS HUMANITY. THE MIRACLES OF THE GOSPEL COULD NOT ASTONISH A PEOPLE WHO HELD WITH INTREPID FAITH THE MORE SPLENDID PRODIGIES OF THE MOSAIC LAW. THE NATURAL SUSPICIONS OF THE HUSBAND CONSCIOUS OF HIS OWN CHASTITY WERE DISPELLED BY THE ASSURANCE IN A DREAM THAT HIS WIFE WAS PREGNANT OF THE HOLY GHOST AND AS THIS DISTANT AND DOMESTIC PRODIGY COULD NOT FALL UNDER THE PERSONAL OBSERVATION OF THE HISTORIAN HE MUST HAVE LISTENED TO THE SAME VOICE WHICH DICTATED TO ISAIAH THE FUTURE CONCEPTION OF A VIRGIN. THE SON OF A VIRGIN GENERATED BY THE INEFFABLE OPERATION OF THE HOLY SPIRIT WAS A CREATURE WITHOUT EXAMPLE OR RESEMBLANCE SUPERIOR IN EVERY ATTRIBUTE OF MIND AND BODY TO THE CHILDREN OF ADAM. ON HIS RETURN TO HIS NATIVE SKIES HE RECEIVED THE IMMENSE REWARD OF HIS OBEDIENCE THE EVERLASTING KINGDOM OF THE MESSIAH WHICH HAD BEEN DARKLY FORETOLD BY THE PROPHETS UNDER THE CARNAL IMAGES OF PEACE OF CONQUEST AND OF DOMINION. NOR COULD IT SEEM STRANGE OR INCREDIBLE THAT THE FIRST OF THESE AEONS THE LOGOS OR WORD OF GOD OF THE SAME SUBSTANCE WITH THE FATHER SHOULD DESCEND UPON EARTH TO DELIVER THE HUMAN RACE FROM VICE AND ERROR AND TO CONDUCT THEM IN THE PATHS OF LIFE AND IMMORTALITY. BUT THE PREVAILING DOCTRINE OF THE ETERNITY AND INHERENT PRAVITY OF MATTER INFECTED THE PRIMITIVE CHURCHES OF THE EAST. MANY AMONG THE GENTILE PROSELYTES REFUSED TO BELIEVE THAT A CELESTIAL SPIRIT AN UNDIVIDED PORTION OF THE FIRST ESSENCE HAD BEEN PERSONALLY UNITED WITH A MASS OF IMPURE AND CONTAMINATED FLESH AND IN THEIR ZEAL FOR THE DIVINITY THEY PIOUSLY ABJURED THE HUMANITY OF CHRIST. HE FIRST APPEARED ON THE BANKS OF THE JORDAN IN THE FORM OF PERFECT MANHOOD BUT IT WAS A FORM ONLY AND NOT A SUBSTANCE A HUMAN FIGURE CREATED BY THE HAND OF OMNIPOTENCE TO IMITATE THE FACULTIES AND ACTIONS OF A MAN AND TO IMPOSE A PERPETUAL ILLUSION ON THE SENSES OF HIS FRIENDS AND ENEMIES. ARTICULATE SOUNDS VIBRATED ON THE EARS OF THE DISCIPLES BUT THE IMAGE WHICH WAS IMPRESSED ON THEIR OPTIC NERVE ELUDED THE MORE STUBBORN EVIDENCE OF THE TOUCH AND THEY ENJOYED THE SPIRITUAL NOT THE CORPOREAL PRESENCE OF THE SON OF GOD. THE RAGE OF THE JEWS WAS IDLY WASTED AGAINST AN IMPASSIVE PHANTOM AND THE MYSTIC SCENES OF THE PASSION AND DEATH THE RESURRECTION AND ASCENSION OF CHRIST WERE REPRESENTED ON THE THEATRE OF JERUSALEM FOR THE BENEFIT OF MANKIND. IF IT WERE URGED THAT SUCH IDEAL MIMICRY SUCH INCESSANT DECEPTION WAS UNWORTHY OF THE GOD OF TRUTH THE DOCETES AGREED WITH TOO MANY OF THEIR ORTHODOX BRETHREN IN THE JUSTIFICATION OF PIOUS FALSEHOOD. BUT THE RASHNESS OF THESE CONCESSIONS HAS ENCOURAGED A MILDER SENTIMENT OF THOSE OF THE DOCETES WHO TAUGHT NOT THAT CHRIST WAS A PHANTOM BUT THAT HE WAS CLOTHED WITH AN IMPASSIBLE AND INCORRUPTIBLE BODY
