IN THE BEGINNING OF THE FIFTH CENTURY THE UNITY OF THE TWO NATURES WAS THE PREVAILING DOCTRINE OF THE CHURCH. ON ALL SIDES IT WAS CONFESSED THAT THE MODE OF THEIR COEXISTENCE COULD NEITHER BE REPRESENTED BY OUR IDEAS NOR EXPRESSED BY OUR LANGUAGE. IMPELLED BY RELIGIOUS FRENZY THEY FLED WITH ADVERSE HASTE FROM THE ERROR WHICH THEY MUTUALLY DEEMED MOST DESTRUCTIVE OF TRUTH AND SALVATION. ON EITHER HAND THEY WERE ANXIOUS TO GUARD THEY WERE JEALOUS TO DEFEND THE UNION AND THE DISTINCTION OF THE TWO NATURES AND TO INVENT SUCH FORMS OF SPEECH SUCH SYMBOLS OF DOCTRINE AS WERE LEAST SUSCEPTIBLE OF DOUBT OR AMBIGUITY.
