EXTERMINATE WITH ME THE HERETICS AND WITH YOU I WILL EXTERMINATE THE PERSIANS. AT THESE BLASPHEMOUS SOUNDS THE PILLARS OF THE SANCTUARY WERE SHAKEN. AFTER A SHORT CORRESPONDENCE IN WHICH THE RIVAL PRELATES DISGUISED THEIR HATRED IN THE HOLLOW LANGUAGE OF RESPECT AND CHARITY THE PATRIARCH OF ALEXANDRIA DENOUNCED TO THE PRINCE AND PEOPLE TO THE EAST AND TO THE WEST THE DAMNABLE ERRORS OF THE BYZANTINE PONTIFF. FROM THE EAST MORE ESPECIALLY FROM ANTIOCH HE OBTAINED THE AMBIGUOUS COUNSELS OF TOLERATION AND SILENCE WHICH WERE ADDRESSED TO BOTH PARTIES WHILE THEY FAVORED THE CAUSE OF NESTORIUS. BUT THE VATICAN RECEIVED WITH OPEN ARMS THE MESSENGERS OF EGYPT. THE VANITY OF CELESTINE WAS FLATTERED BY THE APPEAL AND THE PARTIAL VERSION OF A MONK DECIDED THE FAITH OF THE POPE WHO WITH HIS LATIN CLERGY WAS IGNORANT OF THE LANGUAGE THE ARTS AND THE THEOLOGY OF THE GREEKS. HE HAD CONTRACTED AN INTIMATE ALLIANCE WITH MEMNON BISHOP OF EPHESUS. NESTORIUS WHO DEPENDED ON THE NEAR APPROACH OF HIS EASTERN FRIENDS PERSISTED LIKE HIS PREDECESSOR CHRYSOSTOM TO DISCLAIM THE JURISDICTION AND TO DISOBEY THE SUMMONS OF HIS ENEMIES THEY HASTENED HIS TRIAL AND HIS ACCUSER PRESIDED IN THE SEAT OF JUDGMENT. SIXTY EIGHT BISHOPS TWENTY TWO OF METROPOLITAN RANK DEFENDED HIS CAUSE BY A MODEST AND TEMPERATE PROTEST THEY WERE EXCLUDED FROM THE COUNCILS OF THEIR BRETHREN. CANDIDIAN IN THE EMPEROR'S NAME REQUESTED A DELAY OF FOUR DAYS THE PROFANE MAGISTRATE WAS DRIVEN WITH OUTRAGE AND INSULT FROM THE ASSEMBLY OF THE SAINTS. BY THE VIGILANCE OF MEMNON THE CHURCHES WERE SHUT AGAINST THEM AND A STRONG GARRISON WAS THROWN INTO THE CATHEDRAL. THE TROOPS UNDER THE COMMAND OF CANDIDIAN ADVANCED TO THE ASSAULT THE OUTGUARDS WERE ROUTED AND PUT TO THE SWORD BUT THE PLACE WAS IMPREGNABLE THE BESIEGERS RETIRED THEIR RETREAT WAS PURSUED BY A VIGOROUS SALLY THEY LOST THEIR HORSES AND MANY OF THEIR SOLDIERS WERE DANGEROUSLY WOUNDED WITH CLUBS AND STONES. EPHESUS THE CITY OF THE VIRGIN WAS DEFILED WITH RAGE AND CLAMOR WITH SEDITION AND BLOOD THE RIVAL SYNODS DARTED ANATHEMAS AND EXCOMMUNICATIONS FROM THEIR SPIRITUAL ENGINES AND THE COURT OF THEODOSIUS WAS PERPLEXED BY THE ADVERSE AND CONTRADICTORY NARRATIVES OF THE SYRIAN AND EGYPTIAN FACTIONS. DURING A BUSY PERIOD OF THREE MONTHS THE EMPEROR TRIED EVERY METHOD EXCEPT THE MOST EFFECTUAL MEANS OF INDIFFERENCE AND CONTEMPT TO RECONCILE THIS THEOLOGICAL QUARREL. HE ATTEMPTED TO REMOVE OR INTIMIDATE THE LEADERS BY A COMMON SENTENCE OF ACQUITTAL OR CONDEMNATION HE INVESTED HIS REPRESENTATIVES AT EPHESUS WITH AMPLE POWER AND MILITARY FORCE HE SUMMONED FROM EITHER PARTY EIGHT CHOSEN DEPUTIES TO A FREE AND CANDID CONFERENCE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF THE CAPITAL FAR FROM THE CONTAGION OF POPULAR FRENZY. BUT THE ORIENTALS REFUSED TO YIELD AND THE CATHOLICS PROUD OF THEIR NUMBERS AND OF THEIR LATIN ALLIES REJECTED ALL TERMS OF UNION OR TOLERATION. HIS PROVIDENCE WILL DISCERN AND PUNISH THE GUILTY. RETURN TO YOUR PROVINCES AND MAY YOUR PRIVATE VIRTUES REPAIR THE MISCHIEF AND SCANDAL OF YOUR MEETING. AT THE STERN COMMAND OF HIS SOVEREIGN. WITHOUT EXPECTING THE ROYAL LICENSE HE ESCAPED FROM HIS GUARDS PRECIPITATELY EMBARKED DESERTED THE IMPERFECT SYNOD AND RETIRED TO HIS EPISCOPAL FORTRESS OF SAFETY AND INDEPENDENCE. BUT HIS ARTFUL EMISSARIES BOTH IN THE COURT AND CITY SUCCESSFULLY LABORED TO APPEASE THE RESENTMENT AND TO CONCILIATE THE FAVOR OF THE EMPEROR. THE FEEBLE SON OF ARCADIUS WAS ALTERNATELY SWAYED BY HIS WIFE AND SISTER BY THE EUNUCHS AND WOMEN OF THE PALACE SUPERSTITION AND AVARICE WERE THEIR RULING PASSIONS AND THE ORTHODOX CHIEFS WERE ASSIDUOUS IN THEIR ENDEAVORS TO ALARM THE FORMER AND TO GRATIFY THE LATTER. FROM THE FIRST MOMENT OF THEIR MONASTIC LIFE THEY HAD NEVER MINGLED WITH THE WORLD OR TROD THE PROFANE GROUND OF THE CITY. BUT IN THIS AWFUL MOMENT OF THE DANGER OF THE CHURCH THEIR VOW WAS SUPERSEDED BY A MORE SUBLIME AND INDISPENSABLE DUTY. AT THE HEAD OF A LONG ORDER OF MONKS AND HERMITS WHO CARRIED BURNING TAPERS IN THEIR HANDS AND CHANTED LITANIES TO THE MOTHER OF GOD THEY PROCEEDED FROM THEIR MONASTERIES TO THE PALACE
