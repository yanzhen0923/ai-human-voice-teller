THE PRIZE WAS NOT UNWORTHY OF HIS AMBITION. AT A DISTANCE FROM THE COURT AND AT THE HEAD OF AN IMMENSE CAPITAL THE PATRIARCH AS HE WAS NOW STYLED OF ALEXANDRIA HAD GRADUALLY USURPED THE STATE AND AUTHORITY OF A CIVIL MAGISTRATE. ARDENT IN THE PROSECUTION OF HERESY CYRIL AUSPICIOUSLY OPENED HIS REIGN BY OPPRESSING THE NOVATIANS THE MOST INNOCENT AND HARMLESS OF THE SECTARIES. THE INTERDICTION OF THEIR RELIGIOUS WORSHIP APPEARED IN HIS EYES A JUST AND MERITORIOUS ACT AND HE CONFISCATED THEIR HOLY VESSELS WITHOUT APPREHENDING THE GUILT OF SACRILEGE. THE TOLERATION AND EVEN THE PRIVILEGES OF THE JEWS WHO HAD MULTIPLIED TO THE NUMBER OF FORTY THOUSAND WERE SECURED BY THE LAWS OF THE CAESARS AND PTOLEMIES AND A LONG PRESCRIPTION OF SEVEN HUNDRED YEARS SINCE THE FOUNDATION OF ALEXANDRIA. WITHOUT ANY LEGAL SENTENCE WITHOUT ANY ROYAL MANDATE THE PATRIARCH AT THE DAWN OF DAY LED A SEDITIOUS MULTITUDE TO THE ATTACK OF THE SYNAGOGUES. UNARMED AND UNPREPARED THE JEWS WERE INCAPABLE OF RESISTANCE THEIR HOUSES OF PRAYER WERE LEVELLED WITH THE GROUND AND THE EPISCOPAL WARRIOR AFTER REWARDING HIS TROOPS WITH THE PLUNDER OF THEIR GOODS EXPELLED FROM THE CITY THE REMNANT OF THE UNBELIEVING NATION. PERHAPS HE MIGHT PLEAD THE INSOLENCE OF THEIR PROSPERITY AND THEIR DEADLY HATRED OF THE CHRISTIANS WHOSE BLOOD THEY HAD RECENTLY SHED IN A MALICIOUS OR ACCIDENTAL TUMULT. SUCH CRIMES WOULD HAVE DESERVED THE ANIMADVERSION OF THE MAGISTRATE BUT IN THIS PROMISCUOUS OUTRAGE THE INNOCENT WERE CONFOUNDED WITH THE GUILTY AND ALEXANDRIA WAS IMPOVERISHED BY THE LOSS OF A WEALTHY AND INDUSTRIOUS COLONY. THE ZEAL OF CYRIL EXPOSED HIM TO THE PENALTIES OF THE JULIAN LAW BUT IN A FEEBLE GOVERNMENT AND A SUPERSTITIOUS AGE HE WAS SECURE OF IMPUNITY AND EVEN OF PRAISE. ORESTES COMPLAINED BUT HIS JUST COMPLAINTS WERE TOO QUICKLY FORGOTTEN BY THE MINISTERS OF THEODOSIUS AND TOO DEEPLY REMEMBERED BY A PRIEST WHO AFFECTED TO PARDON AND CONTINUED TO HATE THE PRAEFECT OF EGYPT. AS HE PASSED THROUGH THE STREETS HIS CHARIOT WAS ASSAULTED BY A BAND OF FIVE HUNDRED OF THE NITRIAN MONKS HIS GUARDS FLED FROM THE WILD BEASTS OF THE DESERT HIS PROTESTATIONS THAT HE WAS A CHRISTIAN AND A CATHOLIC WERE ANSWERED BY A VOLLEY OF STONES AND THE FACE OF ORESTES WAS COVERED WITH BLOOD. AT THE COMMAND OF CYRIL HIS BODY WAS RAISED FROM THE GROUND AND TRANSPORTED IN SOLEMN PROCESSION TO THE CATHEDRAL THE NAME OF AMMONIUS WAS CHANGED TO THAT OF THAUMASIUS THE WONDERFUL HIS TOMB WAS DECORATED WITH THE TROPHIES OF MARTYRDOM AND THE PATRIARCH ASCENDED THE PULPIT TO CELEBRATE THE MAGNANIMITY OF AN ASSASSIN AND A REBEL. SUCH HONORS MIGHT INCITE THE FAITHFUL TO COMBAT AND DIE UNDER THE BANNERS OF THE SAINT AND HE SOON PROMPTED OR ACCEPTED THE SACRIFICE OF A VIRGIN WHO PROFESSED THE RELIGION OF THE GREEKS AND CULTIVATED THE FRIENDSHIP OF ORESTES. IN THE BLOOM OF BEAUTY AND IN THE MATURITY OF WISDOM THE MODEST MAID REFUSED HER LOVERS AND INSTRUCTED HER DISCIPLES THE PERSONS MOST ILLUSTRIOUS FOR THEIR RANK OR MERIT WERE IMPATIENT TO VISIT THE FEMALE PHILOSOPHER AND CYRIL BEHELD WITH A JEALOUS EYE THE GORGEOUS TRAIN OF HORSES AND SLAVES WHO CROWDED THE DOOR OF HER ACADEMY. A RUMOR WAS SPREAD AMONG THE CHRISTIANS THAT THE DAUGHTER OF THEON WAS THE ONLY OBSTACLE TO THE RECONCILIATION OF THE PRAEFECT AND THE ARCHBISHOP AND THAT OBSTACLE WAS SPEEDILY REMOVED. WHICH OPPRESSED THE METROPOLITANS OF EUROPE AND ASIA INVADED THE PROVINCES OF ANTIOCH AND ALEXANDRIA AND MEASURED THEIR DIOCESE BY THE LIMITS OF THE EMPIRE. THE LONG MODERATION OF ATTICUS THE MILD USURPER OF THE THRONE OF CHRYSOSTOM SUSPENDED THE ANIMOSITIES OF THE EASTERN PATRIARCHS BUT CYRIL WAS AT LENGTH AWAKENED BY THE EXALTATION OF A RIVAL MORE WORTHY OF HIS ESTEEM AND HATRED. AFTER THE SHORT AND TROUBLED REIGN OF SISINNIUS BISHOP OF CONSTANTINOPLE THE FACTIONS OF THE CLERGY AND PEOPLE WERE APPEASED BY THE CHOICE OF THE EMPEROR WHO ON THIS OCCASION CONSULTED THE VOICE OF FAME AND INVITED THE MERIT OF A STRANGER. GIVE ME O CAESAR HE EXCLAIMED GIVE ME THE EARTH PURGED OF HERETICS AND I WILL GIVE YOU IN EXCHANGE THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN
