OF THE FOUR OTHER COMPANY ENGINEERS TWO WERE NOW STIRRING AND PARTLY CONSCIOUS. THE BOYS FOUND A FIRST AID CABINET AND GAVE WHAT HELP THEY COULD TO THEM AND THE OTHER TWO MEN. THEN TOM TAPED A BANDAGE ON BUD'S SCALP WOUND. LET'S SEE IF WE CAN FIND A TELEPHONE AND CALL THE LOCAL HOSPITAL TOM SAID. RIGHT BUD RESPONDED. THEY PICKED THEIR WAY THROUGH THE WRECKAGE AND EMERGED ON A SCENE OF FRIGHTFUL DESTRUCTION. THE MAIN PLANT BUILDING OF FABER ELECTRONICS HAD BEEN PARTIALLY DEMOLISHED BY THE QUAKE. POWER LINES WERE DOWN AND AN OUTLYING STORAGE SHED WAS ABLAZE. DAZED AND PANIC STRICKEN SURVIVORS WERE WANDERING AROUND AIMLESSLY OR RUSHING ABOUT TO ASSIST THE INJURED. GOOD THING THE MAIN SHIFT OF WORKERS KNOCKED OFF BEFORE THIS HAPPENED BUD OBSERVED WITH A SHUDDER. THERE WOULD'VE BEEN A LOT MORE CASUALTIES LOOK. TOM POINTED TO A HUGE CREVASSE. RIGHT WHERE WE LANDED OUR WHIRLING DUCK. THE BOYS EXCHANGED RUEFUL GLANCES AS THEY REALIZED THAT THE CRAFT WHICH HAD BROUGHT THEM TO FABER ELECTRONICS ONE OF TOM'S UNIQUE HELIJETS HAD BEEN SWALLOWED UP IN THE GAPING CHASM. NO USE FUSSING ABOUT IT NOW TOM SAID COME ON BUD. LET'S SEE ABOUT GETTING HELP FOR MISTER FABER. DESPITE THE CHAOTIC CONFUSION THE BOYS MANAGED TO LOCATE THE PLANT SUPERINTENDENT A HARRIED MIDDLE AGED MAN NAMED SIMKINS WHO WAS DOING HIS BEST TO RESTORE ORDER. SIMKINS WHO HAD NOT BEEN INJURED INFORMED THEM THAT ELECTRICIANS WERE RIGGING AN EMERGENCY TELEPHONE LINE IN ORDER TO GET THROUGH TO THE NEARBY TOWN OF HARKNESS. MISTER FABER IS BADLY INJURED TOM SAID WHY NOT SEND A CAR. IT'S ONLY A FEW MILES AWAY ISN'T IT. HE POINTED WITH A JERK OF HIS THUMB. THE CARS ON THE LOT HAD BEEN SMASHED INTO JUNK BY BRICKS FROM A COLLAPSING WALL OF ONE OF THE BUILDINGS. AND THE ONLY TRUCK WE HAD AVAILABLE WAS IN THAT BURNING SHED THE SUPERINTENDENT ADDED BITTERLY. ANYHOW WE WANT TO HELP GOT A JOB FOR US. SIMKINS WAS ONLY TOO GLAD TO PUT TOM'S QUICK MIND AND KEEN TECHNICAL KNOW HOW TO USE. WITHIN MINUTES TOM WAS IN CHARGE OF CLEARING AWAY RUBBLE AND EXTRICATING ANYONE WHO MIGHT BE TRAPPED INSIDE THE BUILDINGS. BUD ORGANIZED A FIRE FIGHTING CREW TO KEEP THE BLAZE IN THE SHED FROM SPREADING. THE TELEPHONE LINE WAS SOON REPAIRED AND A STEADY STREAM OF RESCUE VEHICLES BEGAN ARRIVING FROM HARKNESS FIRE TRUCKS THREE AMBULANCES AND PRIVATE CARS DRIVEN BY VOLUNTEERS. TWO HOURS LATER THERE WAS NOTHING MORE TOM AND BUD COULD DO AT THE DISASTER SCENE AND THEY HITCHED A RIDE INTO HARKNESS. THE TOWN HAD SUFFERED SOME DAMAGE THOUGH ONLY SLIGHT COMPARED TO THE DESTRUCTION AT THE PLANT. THE CENTER OF THE QUAKE WAS RIGHT UNDER FABER ELECTRONICS TOM REMARKED. FROM A PAY TELEPHONE HE CALLED SWIFT ENTERPRISES IN SHOPTON. THIS WAS THE EXPERIMENTAL STATION WHERE HE AND HIS FATHER DEVELOPED THEIR MANY AMAZING INVENTIONS. TOM ASKED THE OPERATOR TO SEND A HELICOPTER IMMEDIATELY TO PICK THEM UP. HE ALSO CALLED HOME AND SPOKE TO HIS SISTER SANDRA. WHAT A RELIEF SANDY GASPED. WE HEARD A BULLETIN ABOUT THE QUAKE OVER THE RADIO. DON'T WORRY SIS. TELL MOTHER AND DAD THAT WE'RE OKAY TOM SAID. WE'LL BE HOME IN A JIFFY WITH BIG APPETITES. THE HELICOPTER ARRIVED WITHIN TWENTY MINUTES AT THE PLACE TOM HAD NAMED. AFTER LANDING AT ENTERPRISES THE BOYS DROVE TO THE PLEASANT TREE SHADED SWIFT HOME ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF TOWN. MISSUS SWIFT A SLENDER PETITE WOMAN TRIED NOT TO SHOW CONCERN WHEN SHE SAW THE BOYS BRUISED AND DISHEVELED. I'M SO THANKFUL YOU'RE BOTH SAFE SHE MURMURED
