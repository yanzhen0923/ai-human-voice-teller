THE EIGHTEEN YEAR OLD INVENTOR ACCEPTED THE CHALLENGE WITH A SMILE. I'LL BE GLAD TO TRY SIR HE REPLIED. IF ANYONE CAN GET THE BUGS OUT OF YOUR NEW INVENTION GENIUS BOY HERE WILL DO IT. THE TWO BOYS FOLLOWED MISTER FABER AND HIS ENGINEERS TO A WOODEN BUILDING WHICH WAS TIGHTLY GUARDED. INSIDE A SECRET ROCKET TELEMETERING DEVICE WAS MOUNTED ON ITS TEST STAND. AS YOU KNOW TOM MISTER FABER BEGAN THE USUAL CONDITIONS OF ROCKET FLIGHT WILL BE. HE BROKE OFF WITH A GASP OF ASTONISHMENT AS THE WHOLE BUILDING SUDDENLY BEGAN TO SHAKE. GOOD GRIEF BUD EXCLAIMED. THIS ISN'T PART OF YOUR TESTING ROUTINE IS IT. ANOTHER ENGINEER RUSHED TOWARD THE DOOR TO SEE WHAT WAS HAPPENING OUTSIDE. ELECTRONIC EQUIPMENT CASCADED FROM THE WALL SHELVES AND A HEAVY DUTY CHAIN HOIST CAME LOOSE FROM ITS OVERHEAD TRACK PLUNGING TO THE FLOOR WITH A TERRIFYING CRASH. AN EARTHQUAKE TOM GASPED. BUD MEANWHILE CLAWED A HANDHOLD ON A WIRE SCREEN ENCLOSING AN AIR COMPRESSOR AND PULLED HIMSELF TO HIS FEET. BUT THE NEXT MOMENT A THIRD MORE VIOLENT TREMOR ROCKED THE BUILDING KNOCKING HIM OVER. AS HIS EYES FLASHED UPWARD IN PANIC BUD CAUGHT A BRIEF GLIMPSE OF THE PONDEROUS TEST STAND WITH THE PRICELESS TELEMETER TILTING TO ONE SIDE. AN INSTANT LATER IT CRASHED OVER PINNING MARK FABER BENEATH IT. BUD THREW UP HIS ARMS TO PROTECT HIMSELF BUT TOO LATE. A FALLING BEAM CAUGHT HIM ON THE BACK OF THE HEAD AND THE YOUNG FLIER BLACKED OUT. FOR MINUTES NO ONE STIRRED AMONG THE WRECKAGE. THEN TOM WHO HAD BEEN STUNNED BY SOME FALLING DEBRIS RAISED HIMSELF TO A SITTING POSITION. GOOD NIGHT. TOM'S EYES FOCUSED IN HORROR ON THE WRECKAGE ENVELOPED BY STILL BILLOWING DUST. THE SKY WAS VISIBLE THROUGH SEVERAL GAPING HOLES IN THE ROOF WHICH WAS SAGGING DANGEROUSLY ON ITS SUPPORTING TRUSSES. ONLY TWO THIRDS OF THE WALLS WERE STILL STANDING. SUDDENLY TOM STIFFENED IN FEAR BUD. THE YOUNG INVENTOR HAD JUST NOTICED HIS FRIEND LYING PINNED BENEATH A HEAVY BEAM NEARBY. WAS HE STILL BREATHING. DISREGARDING HIS OWN INJURIES TOM HASTILY FREED HIMSELF FROM THE DEBRIS AND GROPED HIS WAY TO BUD'S SIDE. WITH A DESPERATE HEAVE HE SHOVED THE BEAM AWAY THEN CRADLED BUD'S HEAD IN HIS ARM. HIS FRIEND'S EYELIDS FLICKERED. ARE YOU ALL RIGHT TOM ASKED FEARFULLY. THE ANSWER CAME IN A GROAN. YOU GOT CONKED BY A FALLING TIMBER. OR GRAZED AT LEAST TOM ADDED THANKFULLY. IF THAT BEAM HAD LANDED SQUARE ON YOUR NOGGIN EVEN A ROCK HEAD LIKE YOU COULDN'T HAVE SURVIVED. BUD MANAGED TO GRIN. WE GROW EM TOUGH OUT IN CALIFORNIA WHERE I COME FROM HE JOKED. SOMEWHAT SHAKILY BUD GOT TO HIS FEET WITH TOM'S ASSISTANCE. BOTH BOYS WERE HEARTSICK AS THEY SURVEYED THE DAMAGED LABORATORY WONDERING WHERE TO BEGIN RESCUE OPERATIONS. IT WAS A QUAKE BUD STATED GRIMLY. HE HAD HEARD ABOUT THE GREAT SAN FRANCISCO EARTHQUAKE FROM HIS GRANDFATHER AND HAD NO DOUBT ABOUT THE NATURE OF THE TREMORS. JUST THEN TOM GLIMPSED A BODY PROTRUDING FROM UNDER THE WRECKAGE OF THE TELEMETERING DEVICE. MISTER FABER HE GASPED. THE TWO BOYS SCRAMBLED THROUGH THE CLUTTER OF DEBRIS TOWARD THE SPOT WHERE THE TEST STAND HAD BEEN ERECTED. BUD SEIZED A SLENDER STEEL I BEAM AND MANAGED TO PRY UP THE WRECKAGE WHILE TOM CAREFULLY EXTRICATED MISTER FABER. THE SCIENTIST SEEMED TO BE BADLY INJURED. WE'D BETTER NOT TRY TO MOVE HIM TOM DECIDED WE'LL GET AN AMBULANCE
