SID DON'T YOU GET IT. WE'VE FOUND THE MARTIANS. SHE SLAMMED THE PHONE BACK ON ITS HOOK RUSHING AWAY AHEAD OF THEM. MARTHA REMEMBERED THE CLOSED DOOR ON THE FIRST SURVEY THEY HADN'T ATTEMPTED OPENING IT. NOW IT WAS BURNED AWAY AT BOTH SIDES AND LAY STILL HOT ALONG THE EDGES ON THE FLOOR OF THE BIG OFFICE ROOM IN FRONT. A FLOODLIGHT WAS ON IN THE ROOM INSIDE AND LATTIMER WAS GOING AROUND LOOKING AT THINGS WHILE A SPACE FORCE OFFICER STOOD BY THE DOOR. THE CENTER OF THE ROOM WAS FILLED BY A LONG TABLE IN ARMCHAIRS AROUND IT SAT THE EIGHTEEN MEN AND WOMEN WHO HAD OCCUPIED THE ROOM FOR THE LAST FIFTY MILLENNIA. ANOTHER HAD FALLEN FORWARD ONTO THE TABLE ARMS EXTENDED THE EMERALD SET OF A RING TWINKLING DULLY ON ONE FINGER. SKELETONS COVERED WITH LEATHER GLORIA STANDISH HAD CALLED THEM AND SO THEY WERE FACES LIKE SKULLS ARMS AND LEGS LIKE STICKS THE FLESH SHRUNKEN ONTO THE BONES UNDER IT. ISN'T THIS SOMETHING LATTIMER WAS EXULTING. MASS SUICIDE THAT'S WHAT IT WAS NOTICE WHAT'S IN THE CORNERS. BRAZIERS MADE OF PERFORATED TWO GALLON ODD METAL CANS THE WHITE WALLS SMUDGED WITH SMOKE ABOVE THEM. VON OHLMHORST HAD NOTICED THEM AT ONCE AND WAS POKING INTO ONE OF THEM WITH HIS FLASHLIGHT. YES CHARCOAL. I NOTICED A QUANTITY OF IT AROUND A COUPLE OF HAND FORGES IN THE SHOP ON THE FIRST FLOOR. THAT'S WHY YOU HAD SO MUCH TROUBLE BREAKING IN THEY'D SEALED THE ROOM ON THE INSIDE. HE STRAIGHTENED AND WENT AROUND THE ROOM UNTIL HE FOUND A VENTILATOR AND PEERED INTO IT STUFFED WITH RAGS. THEY MUST HAVE BEEN ALL THAT WERE LEFT HERE. THEIR POWER WAS GONE AND THEY WERE OLD AND TIRED AND ALL AROUND THEM THEIR WORLD WAS DYING. SO THEY JUST CAME IN HERE AND LIT THE CHARCOAL AND SAT DRINKING TOGETHER TILL THEY ALL FELL ASLEEP. WELL WE KNOW WHAT BECAME OF THEM NOW ANYHOW. SID AND GLORIA MADE THE MOST OF IT. THE TERRAN PUBLIC WANTED TO HEAR ABOUT MARTIANS AND IF LIVE MARTIANS COULDN'T BE FOUND A ROOM FULL OF DEAD ONES WAS THE NEXT BEST THING. MAYBE AN EVEN BETTER THING IT HAD BEEN ONLY SIXTY ODD YEARS SINCE THE ORSON WELLES INVASION SCARE. TONY LATTIMER THE DISCOVERER WAS BEGINNING TO CASH IN ON HIS ATTENTIONS TO GLORIA AND HIS INGRATIATION WITH SID HE WAS ALWAYS EITHER MAKING VOICE AND IMAGE TALKS FOR TELECAST OR LISTENING TO THE NEWS FROM THE HOME PLANET. WITHOUT QUESTION HE HAD BECOME OVERNIGHT THE MOST WIDELY KNOWN ARCHAEOLOGIST IN HISTORY. NOT THAT I'M INTERESTED IN ALL THIS FOR MYSELF HE DISCLAIMED AFTER LISTENING TO THE TELECAST FROM TERRA TWO DAYS AFTER HIS DISCOVERY. BUT THIS IS GOING TO BE A BIG THING FOR MARTIAN ARCHAEOLOGY. BRING IT TO THE PUBLIC ATTENTION DRAMATIZE IT. IN NINETEEN TWENTY THREE. I REALLY DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH THAT PUBLICITY EVER DID FOR EGYPTOLOGY. OH THE MUSEUMS DID DEVOTE MORE SPACE TO EGYPTIAN EXHIBITS AND AFTER A MUSEUM DEPARTMENT HEAD GETS A FEW EXTRA SHOWCASES YOU KNOW HOW HARD IT IS TO MAKE HIM GIVE THEM UP. AND FOR A WHILE IT WAS EASIER TO GET FINANCIAL SUPPORT FOR NEW EXCAVATIONS. BUT I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH GOOD ALL THIS PUBLIC EXCITEMENT REALLY DOES IN THE LONG RUN. I'D HOPED IT WOULD BE YOU YOUR VOICE WOULD CARRY THE MOST WEIGHT. WE MUST NOT ALLOW THE OTHER SCIENTIFIC FIELDS AND THE SO CALLED PRACTICAL INTERESTS TO MONOPOLIZE PUBLIC AND ACADEMIC SUPPORT. SO I BELIEVE I SHALL GO BACK AT LEAST FOR A WHILE AND SEE WHAT I CAN DO. LECTURES
