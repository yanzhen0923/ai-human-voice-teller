IVAN FITZGERALD FINALLY ISOLATED THE GERM THAT HAD CAUSED THE FINCHLEY GIRL'S UNDIAGNOSED ILLNESS. SHORTLY AFTERWARD THE MALADY TURNED INTO A MILD FEVER FROM WHICH SHE RECOVERED. NOBODY ELSE SEEMED TO HAVE CAUGHT IT. FITZGERALD WAS STILL TRYING TO FIND OUT HOW THE GERM HAD BEEN TRANSMITTED. THEY FOUND A GLOBE OF MARS MADE WHEN THE CITY HAD BEEN A SEAPORT. THEY ALSO FOUND A MARTIAN CALENDAR THE YEAR HAD BEEN DIVIDED INTO TEN MORE OR LESS EQUAL MONTHS AND ONE OF THEM HAD BEEN DOMA. BILL CHANDLER THE ZOOLOGIST HAD BEEN GOING DEEPER AND DEEPER INTO THE OLD SEA BOTTOM OF SYRTIS. FOUR HUNDRED MILES FROM KUKAN AND AT FIFTEEN THOUSAND FEET LOWER ALTITUDE HE SHOT A BIRD. AT LEAST IT WAS A SOMETHING WITH WINGS AND WHAT WERE ALMOST BUT NOT QUITE FEATHERS THOUGH IT WAS MORE REPTILIAN THAN AVIAN IN GENERAL CHARACTERISTICS. HE AND IVAN FITZGERALD SKINNED AND MOUNTED IT AND THEN DISSECTED THE CARCASS ALMOST TISSUE BY TISSUE. THAT TOOK THE CENTER OF INTEREST AWAY FROM ARCHAEOLOGY AND STARTED A NEW BURST OF ACTIVITY. ALL THE EXPEDITION'S AIRCRAFT FOUR JETTICOPTERS AND THREE WINGLESS AIRDYNE RECONNAISSANCE FIGHTERS WERE THROWN INTO INTENSIFIED EXPLORATION OF THE LOWER SEA BOTTOMS AND THE BIO SCIENCE BOYS AND GIRLS WERE WILD WITH EXCITEMENT AND MAKING NEW DISCOVERIES ON EACH FLIGHT. THE UNIVERSITY WAS LEFT TO SELIM AND MARTHA AND TONY LATTIMER THE LATTER KEEPING TO HIMSELF WHILE SHE AND THE OLD TURCO GERMAN WORKED TOGETHER. THE CIVILIAN SPECIALISTS IN OTHER FIELDS AND THE SPACE FORCE PEOPLE WHO HAD BEEN HOLDING TAPE LINES AND MAKING SKETCHES AND SNAPPING CAMERAS WERE ALL FLYING TO LOWER SYRTIS TO FIND OUT HOW MUCH OXYGEN THERE WAS AND WHAT KIND OF LIFE IT SUPPORTED. SOMETIMES SACHIKO DROPPED IN MOST OF THE TIME SHE WAS BUSY HELPING IVAN FITZGERALD DISSECT SPECIMENS. THEY HAD FOUR OR FIVE SPECIES OF WHAT MIGHT LOOSELY BE CALLED BIRDS AND SOMETHING THAT COULD EASILY BE CLASSED AS A REPTILE AND A CARNIVOROUS MAMMAL THE SIZE OF A CAT WITH BIRDLIKE CLAWS AND A HERBIVORE ALMOST IDENTICAL WITH THE PIGLIKE THING IN THE BIG DARFHULVA MURAL AND ANOTHER LIKE A GAZELLE WITH A SINGLE HORN IN THE MIDDLE OF ITS FOREHEAD. THE DAILY NEWSCASTS FROM TERRA SHOWED A CORRESPONDING SHIFT IN INTEREST AT HOME. THE DISCOVERY OF THE UNIVERSITY HAD FOCUSED ATTENTION ON THE DEAD PAST OF MARS NOW THE PUBLIC WAS INTERESTED IN MARS AS A POSSIBLE HOME FOR HUMANITY. IT WAS TONY LATTIMER WHO BROUGHT ARCHAEOLOGY BACK INTO THE ACTIVITIES OF THE EXPEDITION AND THE NEWS AT HOME. IT WAS ONE OF THESE A YOUNG SECOND LIEUTENANT WHO CAME HURRYING IN FROM THE MEZZANINE ALMOST BURSTING WITH EXCITEMENT. HEY MARTHA DOCTOR VON OHLMHORST. HE WAS SHOUTING WHERE ARE YOU. TONY'S FOUND THE MARTIANS. THEY ASKED TOGETHER OVER ON THE NORTH SIDE. THE LIEUTENANT TOOK HOLD OF HIMSELF AND SPOKE MORE DELIBERATELY. LITTLE ROOM BACK OF ONE OF THE OLD FACULTY OFFICES CONFERENCE ROOM. IT WAS LOCKED FROM THE INSIDE AND WE HAD TO BURN IT DOWN WITH A TORCH THAT'S WHERE THEY ARE. EIGHTEEN OF THEM AROUND A LONG TABLE. GLORIA STANDISH WHO HAD DROPPED IN FOR LUNCH WAS ON THE MEZZANINE FAIRLY SCREAMING INTO A RADIOPHONE EXTENSION DOZEN AND A HALF OF THEM. WELL OF COURSE THEY'RE DEAD WHAT A QUESTION. THEY LOOK LIKE SKELETONS COVERED WITH LEATHER. NO I DO NOT KNOW WHAT THEY DIED OF. WELL FORGET IT I DON'T CARE IF BILL CHANDLER'S FOUND A THREE HEADED HIPPOPOTAMUS
