HE WAS YOUNG NO SPEAR HAD TOUCHED HIM NO POISON LURKED IN HIS WINE. BUT HIS VEINS STOOD OUT LIKE BLUE CORDS ON HIS TEMPLES AND HIS EYES DILATED WITH THE NEARNESS OF DEATH. WITH HER WAS THE WAZAM A NOBLE GROWN OLD IN THE ROYAL COURT. THE PRIESTS AND THEIR CLAMOR SHE EXCLAIMED. THEY ARE NO WISER THAN THE LEECHES WHO ARE HELPLESS. HE IS DYING NOW AND I STAND HERE HELPLESS WHO WOULD BURN THE WHOLE CITY AND SPILL THE BLOOD OF THOUSANDS TO SAVE HIM. THIS POISON. I TELL YOU IT IS NOT POISON SHE CRIED. SINCE HIS BIRTH HE HAS BEEN GUARDED SO CLOSELY THAT THE CLEVEREST POISONERS OF THE EAST COULD NOT REACH HIM. FIVE SKULLS BLEACHING ON THE TOWER OF THE KITES CAN TESTIFY TO ATTEMPTS WHICH WERE MADE AND WHICH FAILED. AS YOU WELL KNOW THERE ARE TEN MEN AND TEN WOMEN WHOSE SOLE DUTY IS TO TASTE HIS FOOD AND WINE AND FIFTY ARMED WARRIORS GUARD HIS CHAMBER AS THEY GUARD IT NOW. SHE CEASED AS THE KING SPOKE HIS LIVID LIPS DID NOT MOVE AND THERE WAS NO RECOGNITION IN HIS GLASSY EYES. BUT HIS VOICE ROSE IN AN EERY CALL INDISTINCT AND FAR AWAY AS IF CALLED TO HER FROM BEYOND VAST WIND BLOWN GULFS. YASMINA YASMINA. MY SISTER WHERE ARE YOU. I CAN NOT FIND YOU. ALL IS DARKNESS AND THE ROARING OF GREAT WINDS BROTHER. CRIED YASMINA CATCHING HIS LIMP HAND IN A CONVULSIVE GRASP. I AM HERE DO YOU NOT KNOW ME. HER VOICE DIED AT THE UTTER VACANCY OF HIS FACE. A LOW CONFUSED MOAN WANED FROM HIS MOUTH. THE SLAVE GIRLS AT THE FOOT OF THE DAIS WHIMPERED WITH FEAR AND YASMINA BEAT HER BREAST IN ANGUISH. IN ANOTHER PART OF THE CITY A MAN STOOD IN A LATTICED BALCONY OVERLOOKING A LONG STREET IN WHICH TORCHES TOSSED LURIDLY SMOKILY REVEALING UPTURNED DARK FACES AND THE WHITES OF GLEAMING EYES. A LONG DRAWN WAILING ROSE FROM THE MULTITUDE. THE MAN SHRUGGED HIS BROAD SHOULDERS AND TURNED BACK INTO THE ARABESQUE CHAMBER. HE WAS A TALL MAN COMPACTLY BUILT AND RICHLY CLAD. THE KING IS NOT YET DEAD BUT THE DIRGE IS SOUNDED HE SAID TO ANOTHER MAN WHO SAT CROSS LEGGED ON A MAT IN A CORNER. THIS MAN WAS CLAD IN A BROWN CAMEL HAIR ROBE AND SANDALS AND A GREEN TURBAN WAS ON HIS HEAD. HIS EXPRESSION WAS TRANQUIL HIS GAZE IMPERSONAL. THE PEOPLE KNOW HE WILL NEVER SEE ANOTHER DAWN THIS MAN ANSWERED. THE FIRST SPEAKER FAVORED HIM WITH A LONG SEARCHING STARE. WHAT I CAN NOT UNDERSTAND HE SAID IS WHY I HAVE HAD TO WAIT SO LONG FOR YOUR MASTERS TO STRIKE. IF THEY HAVE SLAIN THE KING NOW WHY COULD THEY NOT HAVE SLAIN HIM MONTHS AGO. EVEN THE ARTS YOU CALL SORCERY ARE GOVERNED BY COSMIC LAWS ANSWERED THE MAN IN THE GREEN TURBAN. THE STARS DIRECT THESE ACTIONS AS IN OTHER AFFAIRS. NOT EVEN MY MASTERS CAN ALTER THE STARS. NOT UNTIL THE HEAVENS WERE IN THE PROPER ORDER COULD THEY PERFORM THIS NECROMANCY. WITH A LONG STAINED FINGERNAIL HE MAPPED THE CONSTELLATIONS ON THE MARBLE TILED FLOOR. THE SLANT OF THE MOON PRESAGED EVIL FOR THE KING OF VENDHYA THE STARS ARE IN TURMOIL THE SERPENT IN THE HOUSE OF THE ELEPHANT. DURING SUCH JUXTAPOSITION THE INVISIBLE GUARDIANS ARE REMOVED FROM THE SPIRIT OF BHUNDA CHAND
