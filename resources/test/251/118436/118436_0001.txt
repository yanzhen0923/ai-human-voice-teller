A PATH IS OPENED IN THE UNSEEN REALMS AND ONCE A POINT OF CONTACT WAS ESTABLISHED MIGHTY POWERS WERE PUT IN PLAY ALONG THAT PATH. POINT OF CONTACT INQUIRED THE OTHER. DO YOU MEAN THAT LOCK OF BHUNDA CHAND'S HAIR YES. ALL DISCARDED PORTIONS OF THE HUMAN BODY STILL REMAIN PART OF IT ATTACHED TO IT BY INTANGIBLE CONNECTIONS. BUT AT THE URGENT ENTREATY OF THE PRINCESS OF KHOSALA WHO LOVED BHUNDA CHAND VAINLY HE GAVE HER A LOCK OF HIS LONG BLACK HAIR AS A TOKEN OF REMEMBRANCE. WHEN MY MASTERS DECIDED UPON HIS DOOM THE LOCK IN ITS GOLDEN JEWEL ENCRUSTED CASE WAS STOLEN FROM UNDER HER PILLOW WHILE SHE SLEPT AND ANOTHER SUBSTITUTED SO LIKE THE FIRST THAT SHE NEVER KNEW THE DIFFERENCE. ONLY A LOCK OF HAIR MURMURED THE NOBLEMAN. BY WHICH A SOUL IS DRAWN FROM ITS BODY AND ACROSS GULFS OF ECHOING SPACE RETURNED THE MAN ON THE MAT. THE NOBLEMAN STUDIED HIM CURIOUSLY. I DO NOT KNOW IF YOU ARE A MAN OR A DEMON KHEMSA HE SAID AT LAST. FEW OF US ARE WHAT WE SEEM. I WHOM THE KSHATRIYAS KNOW AS KERIM SHAH A PRINCE FROM IRANISTAN AM NO GREATER A MASQUERADER THAN MOST MEN. THEY ARE ALL TRAITORS IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER AND HALF OF THEM KNOW NOT WHOM THEY SERVE. THERE AT LEAST I HAVE NO DOUBTS FOR I SERVE KING YEZDIGERD OF TURAN. AND I THE BLACK SEERS OF YIMSHA SAID KHEMSA AND MY MASTERS ARE GREATER THAN YOURS FOR THEY HAVE ACCOMPLISHED BY THEIR ARTS WHAT YEZDIGERD COULD NOT WITH A HUNDRED THOUSAND SWORDS. OUTSIDE THE MOAN OF THE TORTURED THOUSANDS SHUDDERED UP TO THE STARS WHICH CRUSTED THE SWEATING VENDHYAN NIGHT AND THE CONCHS BELLOWED LIKE OXEN IN PAIN. IN THE GARDENS OF THE PALACE THE TORCHES GLINTED ON POLISHED HELMETS AND CURVED SWORDS AND GOLD CHASED CORSELETS. ON THE DAIS UNDER THE GOLDEN DOME THE KING CRIED OUT AGAIN RACKED BY AWFUL PAROXYSMS. YASMINA. AGAIN THAT FAR WEIRDLY DREEING CRY FROM REALMS IMMEASURABLE AID ME. I AM FAR FROM MY MORTAL HOUSE. WIZARDS HAVE DRAWN MY SOUL THROUGH THE WIND BLOWN DARKNESS. THEY SEEK TO SNAP THE SILVER CORD THAT BINDS ME TO MY DYING BODY. THEY CLUSTER AROUND ME THEIR HANDS ARE TALONED THEIR EYES ARE RED LIKE FLAME BURNING IN DARKNESS. THEIR FINGERS SEAR ME LIKE FIRE. THEY WOULD SLAY MY BODY AND DAMN MY SOUL. AT THE TERROR IN HIS HOPELESS CRY YASMINA SCREAMED UNCONTROLLABLY AND THREW HERSELF BODILY UPON HIM IN THE ABANDON OF HER ANGUISH. BUT THE GLASSY BLANKNESS PASSED FROM HIS EYES LIKE SMOKE BLOWN FROM A FIRE AND HE LOOKED UP AT HIS SISTER WITH RECOGNITION. BROTHER SHE SOBBED. BROTHER SWIFT. HE GASPED AND HIS WEAKENING VOICE WAS RATIONAL. I KNOW NOW WHAT BRINGS ME TO THE PYRE. I HAVE BEEN ON A FAR JOURNEY AND I UNDERSTAND. I HAVE BEEN ENSORCELLED BY THE WIZARDS OF THE HIMELIANS. THEY DREW MY SOUL OUT OF MY BODY AND FAR AWAY INTO A STONE ROOM. THERE THEY STROVE TO BREAK THE SILVER CORD OF LIFE AND THRUST MY SOUL INTO THE BODY OF A FOUL NIGHT WEIRD THEIR SORCERY SUMMONED UP FROM HELL AH. I FEEL THEIR PULL UPON ME NOW. YOUR CRY AND THE GRIP OF YOUR FINGERS BROUGHT ME BACK BUT I AM GOING FAST
