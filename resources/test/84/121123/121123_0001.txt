SIR SAID VILLEFORT STRIVING TO STRUGGLE AGAINST THIS TRIPLE FORCE AND HIS OWN EMOTION SIR YOU ARE DECEIVED NO ONE COMMITS CRIMES HERE. I AM STRICKEN BY FATE IT IS HORRIBLE INDEED BUT NO ONE ASSASSINATES. MORREL HOWEVER EXTENDED HIS ARM AND COMMANDED SILENCE. I TELL YOU THAT YOU KNOW THESE THINGS AS WELL AS I DO SINCE THIS GENTLEMAN HAS FOREWARNED YOU BOTH AS A DOCTOR AND AS A FRIEND. OH YOU RAVE SIR EXCLAIMED VILLEFORT IN VAIN ENDEAVORING TO ESCAPE THE NET IN WHICH HE WAS TAKEN I RAVE. ASK HIM SIR IF HE RECOLLECTS THE WORDS HE UTTERED IN THE GARDEN OF THIS HOUSE ON THE NIGHT OF MADAME DE SAINT MERAN'S DEATH. YOU THOUGHT YOURSELVES ALONE AND TALKED ABOUT THAT TRAGICAL DEATH AND THE FATALITY YOU MENTIONED THEN IS THE SAME WHICH HAS CAUSED THE MURDER OF VALENTINE. YES YES CONTINUED MORREL RECALL THE SCENE FOR THE WORDS YOU THOUGHT WERE ONLY GIVEN TO SILENCE AND SOLITUDE FELL INTO MY EARS. YES INDICATED NOIRTIER WITH AN EXPRESSION THE MORE TERRIBLE FROM ALL HIS FACULTIES BEING CENTRED IN HIS GLANCE. DO YOU KNOW THE ASSASSIN ASKED MORREL. YES REPLIED NOIRTIER. NOIRTIER LOOKED UPON MORREL WITH ONE OF THOSE MELANCHOLY SMILES WHICH HAD SO OFTEN MADE VALENTINE HAPPY AND THUS FIXED HIS ATTENTION. THEN HAVING RIVETED THE EYES OF HIS INTERLOCUTOR ON HIS OWN HE GLANCED TOWARDS THE DOOR DO YOU WISH ME TO LEAVE. SAID MORREL SADLY YES REPLIED NOIRTIER. ALAS ALAS SIR HAVE PITY ON ME. THE OLD MAN'S EYES REMAINED FIXED ON THE DOOR. MAY I AT LEAST RETURN. ASKED MORREL YES. MUST I LEAVE ALONE NO. THE DOCTOR YES. BUT CAN HE UNDERSTAND YOU YES. D'AVRIGNY TOOK THE YOUNG MAN'S ARM AND LED HIM OUT OF THE ROOM A MORE THAN DEATHLIKE SILENCE THEN REIGNED IN THE HOUSE. YOU CAN COME HE SAID AND LED THEM BACK TO NOIRTIER. MORREL LOOKED ATTENTIVELY ON VILLEFORT HIS FACE WAS LIVID LARGE DROPS ROLLED DOWN HIS FACE AND IN HIS FINGERS HE HELD THE FRAGMENTS OF A QUILL PEN WHICH HE HAD TORN TO ATOMS. GENTLEMEN HE SAID IN A HOARSE VOICE GIVE ME YOUR WORD OF HONOR THAT THIS HORRIBLE SECRET SHALL FOREVER REMAIN BURIED AMONGST OURSELVES THE TWO MEN DREW BACK. I ENTREAT YOU CONTINUED VILLEFORT. BUT SAID MORREL THE CULPRIT THE MURDERER THE ASSASSIN. DO NOT ALARM YOURSELF SIR JUSTICE WILL BE DONE SAID VILLEFORT. MY FATHER HAS REVEALED THE CULPRIT'S NAME MY FATHER THIRSTS FOR REVENGE AS MUCH AS YOU DO YET EVEN HE CONJURES YOU AS I DO TO KEEP THIS SECRET DO YOU NOT FATHER. YES RESOLUTELY REPLIED NOIRTIER. MORREL SUFFERED AN EXCLAMATION OF HORROR AND SURPRISE TO ESCAPE HIM. OH SIR SAID VILLEFORT ARRESTING MAXIMILIAN BY THE ARM IF MY FATHER THE INFLEXIBLE MAN MAKES THIS REQUEST IT IS BECAUSE HE KNOWS BE ASSURED THAT VALENTINE WILL BE TERRIBLY REVENGED IS IT NOT SO FATHER. THE OLD MAN MADE A SIGN IN THE AFFIRMATIVE. VILLEFORT CONTINUED HE KNOWS ME AND I HAVE PLEDGED MY WORD TO HIM REST ASSURED GENTLEMEN THAT WITHIN THREE DAYS IN A LESS TIME THAN JUSTICE WOULD DEMAND THE REVENGE I SHALL HAVE TAKEN FOR THE MURDER OF MY CHILD WILL BE SUCH AS TO MAKE THE BOLDEST HEART TREMBLE AND AS HE SPOKE THESE WORDS HE GROUND HIS TEETH AND GRASPED THE OLD MAN'S SENSELESS HAND. YES REPLIED NOIRTIER WITH AN EXPRESSION OF SINISTER JOY. D'AVRIGNY TURNED ROUND AND UTTERED A VERY FEEBLE YES BUT MORREL DISENGAGING HIS HAND RUSHED TO THE BED AND AFTER HAVING PRESSED THE COLD LIPS OF VALENTINE WITH HIS OWN HURRIEDLY LEFT UTTERING A LONG DEEP GROAN OF DESPAIR AND ANGUISH. WE HAVE BEFORE STATED THAT ALL THE SERVANTS HAD FLED. IT WAS SOMETHING TERRIBLE TO WITNESS THE SILENT AGONY THE MUTE DESPAIR OF NOIRTIER WHOSE TEARS SILENTLY ROLLED DOWN HIS CHEEKS. BUT HE STOPPED ON THE LANDING HE HAD NOT THE COURAGE TO AGAIN VISIT THE DEATH CHAMBER. THE TWO DOCTORS THEREFORE ENTERED THE ROOM ALONE. NOIRTIER WAS NEAR THE BED PALE MOTIONLESS AND SILENT AS THE CORPSE. THE DISTRICT DOCTOR APPROACHED WITH THE INDIFFERENCE OF A MAN ACCUSTOMED TO SPEND HALF HIS TIME AMONGST THE DEAD HE THEN LIFTED THE SHEET WHICH WAS PLACED OVER THE FACE AND JUST UNCLOSED THE LIPS. YES ANSWERED THE DOCTOR LACONICALLY DROPPING THE SHEET HE HAD RAISED
