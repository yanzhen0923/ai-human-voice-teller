HIS GLANCE AT FIRST WANDERING FIXED ITSELF UPON MORREL. WHO ARE YOU SIR HE ASKED THAT FORGET THAT THIS IS NOT THE MANNER TO ENTER A HOUSE STRICKEN WITH DEATH GO SIR GO. BUT MORREL REMAINED MOTIONLESS HE COULD NOT DETACH HIS EYES FROM THAT DISORDERED BED AND THE PALE CORPSE OF THE YOUNG GIRL WHO WAS LYING ON IT. GO DO YOU HEAR. BUT IN LESS THAN FIVE MINUTES THE STAIRCASE GROANED BENEATH AN EXTRAORDINARY WEIGHT. MORREL WAS SEEN CARRYING WITH SUPERHUMAN STRENGTH THE ARM CHAIR CONTAINING NOIRTIER UP STAIRS. WHEN HE REACHED THE LANDING HE PLACED THE ARM CHAIR ON THE FLOOR AND RAPIDLY ROLLED IT INTO VALENTINE'S ROOM. THIS COULD ONLY HAVE BEEN ACCOMPLISHED BY MEANS OF UNNATURAL STRENGTH SUPPLIED BY POWERFUL EXCITEMENT. BUT THE MOST FEARFUL SPECTACLE WAS NOIRTIER BEING PUSHED TOWARDS THE BED HIS FACE EXPRESSING ALL HIS MEANING AND HIS EYES SUPPLYING THE WANT OF EVERY OTHER FACULTY. CRIED MORREL WITH ONE HAND LEANING ON THE BACK OF THE CHAIR AND THE OTHER EXTENDED TOWARDS VALENTINE SEE MY FATHER SEE. VILLEFORT DREW BACK AND LOOKED WITH ASTONISHMENT ON THE YOUNG MAN WHO ALMOST A STRANGER TO HIM CALLED NOIRTIER HIS FATHER. AT THIS MOMENT THE WHOLE SOUL OF THE OLD MAN SEEMED CENTRED IN HIS EYES WHICH BECAME BLOODSHOT THE VEINS OF THE THROAT SWELLED HIS CHEEKS AND TEMPLES BECAME PURPLE AS THOUGH HE WAS STRUCK WITH EPILEPSY NOTHING WAS WANTING TO COMPLETE THIS BUT THE UTTERANCE OF A CRY. AND THE CRY ISSUED FROM HIS PORES IF WE MAY THUS SPEAK A CRY FRIGHTFUL IN ITS SILENCE. D'AVRIGNY RUSHED TOWARDS THE OLD MAN AND MADE HIM INHALE A POWERFUL RESTORATIVE. SIR CRIED MORREL SEIZING THE MOIST HAND OF THE PARALYTIC THEY ASK ME WHO I AM AND WHAT RIGHT I HAVE TO BE HERE. OH YOU KNOW IT TELL THEM TELL THEM. AND THE YOUNG MAN'S VOICE WAS CHOKED BY SOBS. AS FOR THE OLD MAN HIS CHEST HEAVED WITH HIS PANTING RESPIRATION. AT LENGTH HAPPIER THAN THE YOUNG MAN WHO SOBBED WITHOUT WEEPING TEARS GLISTENED IN THE EYES OF NOIRTIER. TELL THEM SAID MORREL IN A HOARSE VOICE TELL THEM THAT I AM HER BETROTHED TELL THEM SHE WAS MY BELOVED MY NOBLE GIRL MY ONLY BLESSING IN THE WORLD. TELL THEM OH TELL THEM THAT CORPSE BELONGS TO ME. D'AVRIGNY UNABLE TO BEAR THE SIGHT OF THIS TOUCHING EMOTION TURNED AWAY AND VILLEFORT WITHOUT SEEKING ANY FURTHER EXPLANATION AND ATTRACTED TOWARDS HIM BY THE IRRESISTIBLE MAGNETISM WHICH DRAWS US TOWARDS THOSE WHO HAVE LOVED THE PEOPLE FOR WHOM WE MOURN EXTENDED HIS HAND TOWARDS THE YOUNG MAN. BUT MORREL SAW NOTHING HE HAD GRASPED THE HAND OF VALENTINE AND UNABLE TO WEEP VENTED HIS AGONY IN GROANS AS HE BIT THE SHEETS. FOR SOME TIME NOTHING WAS HEARD IN THAT CHAMBER BUT SOBS EXCLAMATIONS AND PRAYERS. I KNEW NOTHING OF THIS ENGAGEMENT OF THIS LOVE YET I HER FATHER FORGIVE YOU FOR I SEE THAT YOUR GRIEF IS REAL AND DEEP AND BESIDES MY OWN SORROW IS TOO GREAT FOR ANGER TO FIND A PLACE IN MY HEART. BUT YOU SEE THAT THE ANGEL WHOM YOU HOPED FOR HAS LEFT THIS EARTH SHE HAS NOTHING MORE TO DO WITH THE ADORATION OF MEN. TAKE A LAST FAREWELL SIR OF HER SAD REMAINS TAKE THE HAND YOU EXPECTED TO POSSESS ONCE MORE WITHIN YOUR OWN AND THEN SEPARATE YOURSELF FROM HER FOREVER. VALENTINE NOW REQUIRES ONLY THE MINISTRATIONS OF THE PRIEST. WHAT DO YOU MEAN SIR. ASKED VILLEFORT TREMBLING AT THE NEW IDEA INSPIRED BY THE DELIRIUM OF MORREL. I TELL YOU SIR THAT TWO PERSONS EXIST IN YOU THE FATHER HAS MOURNED SUFFICIENTLY NOW LET THE PROCUREUR FULFIL HIS OFFICE. GENTLEMEN SAID MORREL READING ALL THAT PASSED THROUGH THE MINDS OF THE WITNESSES TO THE SCENE I KNOW WHAT I AM SAYING AND YOU KNOW AS WELL AS I DO WHAT I AM ABOUT TO SAY VALENTINE HAS BEEN ASSASSINATED. NOW SIR CONTINUED MORREL IN THESE DAYS NO ONE CAN DISAPPEAR BY VIOLENT MEANS WITHOUT SOME INQUIRIES BEING MADE AS TO THE CAUSE OF HER DISAPPEARANCE EVEN WERE SHE NOT A YOUNG BEAUTIFUL AND ADORABLE CREATURE LIKE VALENTINE. MISTER PROCUREUR SAID MORREL WITH INCREASING VEHEMENCE NO MERCY IS ALLOWED I DENOUNCE THE CRIME IT IS YOUR PLACE TO SEEK THE ASSASSIN. YES INDICATED THE OLD MAN
