THE FACULTY THAT LENDS DISCOURSE TO REASON DID APPREHEND THAT THEY WERE CANDLESTICKS AND IN THE VOICES OF THE SONG HOSANNA. ABOVE THEM FLAMED THE HARNESS BEAUTIFUL FAR BRIGHTER THAN THE MOON IN THE SERENE OF MIDNIGHT AT THE MIDDLE OF HER MONTH. I TURNED ME ROUND WITH ADMIRATION FILLED TO GOOD VIRGILIUS AND HE ANSWERED ME WITH VISAGE NO LESS FULL OF WONDERMENT. THEN BACK I TURNED MY FACE TO THOSE HIGH THINGS WHICH MOVED THEMSELVES TOWARDS US SO SEDATELY THEY HAD BEEN DISTANCED BY NEW WEDDED BRIDES. THE LADY CHID ME WHY DOST THOU BURN ONLY SO WITH AFFECTION FOR THE LIVING LIGHTS AND DOST NOT LOOK AT WHAT COMES AFTER THEM. THEN SAW I PEOPLE AS BEHIND THEIR LEADERS COMING BEHIND THEM GARMENTED IN WHITE AND SUCH A WHITENESS NEVER WAS ON EARTH. THE WATER ON MY LEFT FLANK WAS RESPLENDENT AND BACK TO ME REFLECTED MY LEFT SIDE E'EN AS A MIRROR IF I LOOKED THEREIN. AND I BEHELD THE FLAMELETS ONWARD GO LEAVING BEHIND THEMSELVES THE AIR DEPICTED AND THEY OF TRAILING PENNONS HAD THE SEMBLANCE SO THAT IT OVERHEAD REMAINED DISTINCT WITH SEVENFOLD LISTS ALL OF THEM OF THE COLOURS WHENCE THE SUN'S BOW IS MADE AND DELIA'S GIRDLE. THESE STANDARDS TO THE REARWARD LONGER WERE THAN WAS MY SIGHT AND AS IT SEEMED TO ME TEN PACES WERE THE OUTERMOST APART. PLUMED WITH SIX WINGS WAS EVERY ONE OF THEM THE PLUMAGE FULL OF EYES THE EYES OF ARGUS IF THEY WERE LIVING WOULD BE SUCH AS THESE. READER TO TRACE THEIR FORMS NO MORE I WASTE MY RHYMES FOR OTHER SPENDINGS PRESS ME SO THAT I IN THIS CANNOT BE PRODIGAL. BUT READ EZEKIEL WHO DEPICTETH THEM AS HE BEHELD THEM FROM THE REGION COLD COMING WITH CLOUD WITH WHIRLWIND AND WITH FIRE. AND SUCH AS THOU SHALT FIND THEM IN HIS PAGES SUCH WERE THEY HERE SAVING THAT IN THEIR PLUMAGE JOHN IS WITH ME AND DIFFERETH FROM HIM. THE INTERVAL BETWEEN THESE FOUR CONTAINED A CHARIOT TRIUMPHAL ON TWO WHEELS WHICH BY A GRIFFIN'S NECK CAME DRAWN ALONG. AND UPWARD HE EXTENDED BOTH HIS WINGS BETWEEN THE MIDDLE LIST AND THREE AND THREE SO THAT HE INJURED NONE BY CLEAVING IT. SO HIGH THEY ROSE THAT THEY WERE LOST TO SIGHT HIS LIMBS WERE GOLD SO FAR AS HE WAS BIRD AND WHITE THE OTHERS WITH VERMILION MINGLED. NOT ONLY ROME WITH NO SUCH SPLENDID CAR E'ER GLADDENED AFRICANUS OR AUGUSTUS BUT POOR TO IT THAT OF THE SUN WOULD BE. THAT OF THE SUN WHICH SWERVING WAS BURNT UP AT THE IMPORTUNATE ORISON OF EARTH WHEN JOVE WAS SO MYSTERIOUSLY JUST. THREE MAIDENS AT THE RIGHT WHEEL IN A CIRCLE CAME ONWARD DANCING ONE SO VERY RED THAT IN THE FIRE SHE HARDLY HAD BEEN NOTED. THE SECOND WAS AS IF HER FLESH AND BONES HAD ALL BEEN FASHIONED OUT OF EMERALD THE THIRD APPEARED AS SNOW BUT NEWLY FALLEN. AND NOW THEY SEEMED CONDUCTED BY THE WHITE NOW BY THE RED AND FROM THE SONG OF HER THE OTHERS TOOK THEIR STEP OR SLOW OR SWIFT. UPON THE LEFT HAND FOUR MADE HOLIDAY VESTED IN PURPLE FOLLOWING THE MEASURE OF ONE OF THEM WITH THREE EYES M HER HEAD. IN REAR OF ALL THE GROUP HERE TREATED OF TWO OLD MEN I BEHELD UNLIKE IN HABIT BUT LIKE IN GAIT EACH DIGNIFIED AND GRAVE. ONE SHOWED HIMSELF AS ONE OF THE DISCIPLES OF THAT SUPREME HIPPOCRATES WHOM NATURE MADE FOR THE ANIMALS SHE HOLDS MOST DEAR. CONTRARY CARE THE OTHER MANIFESTED WITH SWORD SO SHINING AND SO SHARP IT CAUSED TERROR TO ME ON THIS SIDE OF THE RIVER. THEREAFTER FOUR I SAW OF HUMBLE ASPECT AND BEHIND ALL AN AGED MAN ALONE WALKING IN SLEEP WITH COUNTENANCE ACUTE
