THEREFORE MY ANSWER IS WITH GREATER CARE THAT HE MAY HEAR ME WHO IS WEEPING YONDER SO THAT THE SIN AND DOLE BE OF ONE MEASURE. NOT ONLY BY THE WORK OF THOSE GREAT WHEELS THAT DESTINE EVERY SEED UNTO SOME END ACCORDING AS THE STARS ARE IN CONJUNCTION. BUT BY THE LARGESS OF CELESTIAL GRACES WHICH HAVE SUCH LOFTY VAPOURS FOR THEIR RAIN THAT NEAR TO THEM OUR SIGHT APPROACHES NOT. SUCH HAD THIS MAN BECOME IN HIS NEW LIFE POTENTIALLY THAT EVERY RIGHTEOUS HABIT WOULD HAVE MADE ADMIRABLE PROOF IN HIM. BUT SO MUCH MORE MALIGNANT AND MORE SAVAGE BECOMES THE LAND UNTILLED AND WITH BAD SEED THE MORE GOOD EARTHLY VIGOUR IT POSSESSES. SOME TIME DID I SUSTAIN HIM WITH MY LOOK REVEALING UNTO HIM MY YOUTHFUL EYES I LED HIM WITH ME TURNED IN THE RIGHT WAY. AS SOON AS EVER OF MY SECOND AGE I WAS UPON THE THRESHOLD AND CHANGED LIFE HIMSELF FROM ME HE TOOK AND GAVE TO OTHERS. WHEN FROM THE FLESH TO SPIRIT I ASCENDED AND BEAUTY AND VIRTUE WERE IN ME INCREASED I WAS TO HIM LESS DEAR AND LESS DELIGHTFUL. AND INTO WAYS UNTRUE HE TURNED HIS STEPS PURSUING THE FALSE IMAGES OF GOOD THAT NEVER ANY PROMISES FULFIL. NOR PRAYER FOR INSPIRATION ME AVAILED BY MEANS OF WHICH IN DREAMS AND OTHERWISE I CALLED HIM BACK SO LITTLE DID HE HEED THEM. SO LOW HE FELL THAT ALL APPLIANCES FOR HIS SALVATION WERE ALREADY SHORT SAVE SHOWING HIM THE PEOPLE OF PERDITION. FOR THIS I VISITED THE GATES OF DEATH AND UNTO HIM WHO SO FAR UP HAS LED HIM MY INTERCESSIONS WERE WITH WEEPING BORNE. MY FACULTIES WERE IN SO GREAT CONFUSION THAT THE VOICE MOVED BUT SOONER WAS EXTINCT THAN BY ITS ORGANS IT WAS SET AT LARGE. ANSWER ME FOR THE MOURNFUL MEMORIES IN THEE NOT YET ARE BY THE WATERS INJURED. CONFUSION AND DISMAY TOGETHER MINGLED FORCED SUCH A YES FROM OUT MY MOUTH THAT SIGHT WAS NEEDFUL TO THE UNDERSTANDING OF IT. EVEN AS A CROSS BOW BREAKS WHEN TIS DISCHARGED TOO TENSELY DRAWN THE BOWSTRING AND THE BOW AND WITH LESS FORCE THE ARROW HITS THE MARK SO I GAVE WAY BENEATH THAT HEAVY BURDEN OUTPOURING IN A TORRENT TEARS AND SIGHS AND THE VOICE FLAGGED UPON ITS PASSAGE FORTH. WHENCE SHE TO ME IN THOSE DESIRES OF MINE WHICH LED THEE TO THE LOVING OF THAT GOOD BEYOND WHICH THERE IS NOTHING TO ASPIRE TO. WHAT TRENCHES LYING TRAVERSE OR WHAT CHAINS DIDST THOU DISCOVER THAT OF PASSING ONWARD THOU SHOULDST HAVE THUS DESPOILED THEE OF THE HOPE. AND WHAT ALLUREMENTS OR WHAT VANTAGES UPON THE FOREHEAD OF THE OTHERS SHOWED THAT THOU SHOULDST TURN THY FOOTSTEPS UNTO THEM. AFTER THE HEAVING OF A BITTER SIGH HARDLY HAD I THE VOICE TO MAKE RESPONSE AND WITH FATIGUE MY LIPS DID FASHION IT. WEEPING I SAID THE THINGS THAT PRESENT WERE WITH THEIR FALSE PLEASURE TURNED ASIDE MY STEPS SOON AS YOUR COUNTENANCE CONCEALED ITSELF
