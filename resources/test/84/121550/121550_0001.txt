NOW SINCE THE UNIVERSAL ATMOSPHERE TURNS IN A CIRCUIT WITH THE PRIMAL MOTION UNLESS THE CIRCLE IS BROKEN ON SOME SIDE UPON THIS HEIGHT THAT ALL IS DISENGAGED IN LIVING ETHER DOTH THIS MOTION STRIKE AND MAKE THE FOREST SOUND FOR IT IS DENSE. AND SO MUCH POWER THE STRICKEN PLANT POSSESSES THAT WITH ITS VIRTUE IT IMPREGNS THE AIR AND THIS REVOLVING SCATTERS IT AROUND. AND YONDER EARTH ACCORDING AS TIS WORTHY IN SELF OR IN ITS CLIME CONCEIVES AND BEARS OF DIVERS QUALITIES THE DIVERS TREES. IT SHOULD NOT SEEM A MARVEL THEN ON EARTH THIS BEING HEARD WHENEVER ANY PLANT WITHOUT SEED MANIFEST THERE TAKETH ROOT. AND THOU MUST KNOW THIS HOLY TABLE LAND IN WHICH THOU ART IS FULL OF EVERY SEED AND FRUIT HAS IN IT NEVER GATHERED THERE. THE WATER WHICH THOU SEEST SPRINGS NOT FROM VEIN RESTORED BY VAPOUR THAT THE COLD CONDENSES LIKE TO A STREAM THAT GAINS OR LOSES BREATH BUT ISSUES FROM A FOUNTAIN SAFE AND CERTAIN WHICH BY THE WILL OF GOD AS MUCH REGAINS AS IT DISCHARGES OPEN ON TWO SIDES. THIS EVERY OTHER SAVOUR DOTH TRANSCEND AND NOTWITHSTANDING SLAKED SO FAR MAY BE THY THIRST THAT I REVEAL TO THEE NO MORE. I'LL GIVE THEE A COROLLARY STILL IN GRACE NOR THINK MY SPEECH WILL BE TO THEE LESS DEAR IF IT SPREAD OUT BEYOND MY PROMISE TO THEE. THOSE WHO IN ANCIENT TIMES HAVE FEIGNED IN SONG THE AGE OF GOLD AND ITS FELICITY DREAMED OF THIS PLACE PERHAPS UPON PARNASSUS. HERE WAS THE HUMAN RACE IN INNOCENCE HERE EVERMORE WAS SPRING AND EVERY FRUIT THIS IS THE NECTAR OF WHICH EACH ONE SPEAKS. THEN TO THE BEAUTIFUL LADY TURNED MINE EYES. AND EVEN AS NYMPHS THAT WANDERED ALL ALONE AMONG THE SYLVAN SHADOWS SEDULOUS ONE TO AVOID AND ONE TO SEE THE SUN SHE THEN AGAINST THE STREAM MOVED ONWARD GOING ALONG THE BANK AND I ABREAST OF HER HER LITTLE STEPS WITH LITTLE STEPS ATTENDING. BETWEEN HER STEPS AND MINE WERE NOT A HUNDRED WHEN EQUALLY THE MARGINS GAVE A TURN IN SUCH A WAY THAT TO THE EAST I FACED. NOR EVEN THUS OUR WAY CONTINUED FAR BEFORE THE LADY WHOLLY TURNED HERSELF UNTO ME SAYING BROTHER LOOK AND LISTEN. AND LO A SUDDEN LUSTRE RAN ACROSS ON EVERY SIDE ATHWART THE SPACIOUS FOREST SUCH THAT IT MADE ME DOUBT IF IT WERE LIGHTNING. BUT SINCE THE LIGHTNING CEASES AS IT COMES AND THAT CONTINUING BRIGHTENED MORE AND MORE WITHIN MY THOUGHT I SAID WHAT THING IS THIS. AND A DELICIOUS MELODY THERE RAN ALONG THE LUMINOUS AIR WHENCE HOLY ZEAL MADE ME REBUKE THE HARDIHOOD OF EVE. FOR THERE WHERE EARTH AND HEAVEN OBEDIENT WERE THE WOMAN ONLY AND BUT JUST CREATED COULD NOT ENDURE TO STAY NEATH ANY VEIL UNDERNEATH WHICH HAD SHE DEVOUTLY STAYED I SOONER SHOULD HAVE TASTED THOSE DELIGHTS INEFFABLE AND FOR A LONGER TIME. WHILE MID SUCH MANIFOLD FIRST FRUITS I WALKED OF THE ETERNAL PLEASURE ALL ENRAPT AND STILL SOLICITOUS OF MORE DELIGHTS. IN FRONT OF US LIKE AN ENKINDLED FIRE BECAME THE AIR BENEATH THE VERDANT BOUGHS AND THE SWEET SOUND AS SINGING NOW WAS HEARD. O VIRGINS SACROSANCT. IF EVER HUNGER VIGILS OR COLD FOR YOU I HAVE ENDURED THE OCCASION SPURS ME THEIR REWARD TO CLAIM. NOW HELICON MUST NEEDS POUR FORTH FOR ME AND WITH HER CHOIR URANIA MUST ASSIST ME TO PUT IN VERSE THINGS DIFFICULT TO THINK. A LITTLE FARTHER ON SEVEN TREES OF GOLD IN SEMBLANCE THE LONG SPACE STILL INTERVENING BETWEEN OURSELVES AND THEM DID COUNTERFEIT. BUT WHEN I HAD APPROACHED SO NEAR TO THEM THE COMMON OBJECT WHICH THE SENSE DECEIVES LOST NOT BY DISTANCE ANY OF ITS MARKS
