WHEREAT THE BRANCHES LIGHTLY TREMULOUS DID ALL OF THEM BOW DOWNWARD TOWARD THAT SIDE WHERE ITS FIRST SHADOW CASTS THE HOLY MOUNTAIN. YET NOT FROM THEIR UPRIGHT DIRECTION SWAYED SO THAT THE LITTLE BIRDS UPON THEIR TOPS SHOULD LEAVE THE PRACTICE OF EACH ART OF THEIRS. BUT WITH FULL RAVISHMENT THE HOURS OF PRIME SINGING RECEIVED THEY IN THE MIDST OF LEAVES THAT EVER BORE A BURDEN TO THEIR RHYMES. ALREADY MY SLOW STEPS HAD CARRIED ME INTO THE ANCIENT WOOD SO FAR THAT I COULD NOT PERCEIVE WHERE I HAD ENTERED IT AND LO. ALL WATERS THAT ON EARTH MOST LIMPID ARE WOULD SEEM TO HAVE WITHIN THEMSELVES SOME MIXTURE COMPARED WITH THAT WHICH NOTHING DOTH CONCEAL. ALTHOUGH IT MOVES ON WITH A BROWN BROWN CURRENT UNDER THE SHADE PERPETUAL THAT NEVER RAY OF THE SUN LETS IN NOR OF THE MOON. WITH FEET I STAYED AND WITH MINE EYES I PASSED BEYOND THE RIVULET TO LOOK UPON THE GREAT VARIETY OF THE FRESH MAY. AND THERE APPEARED TO ME EVEN AS APPEARS SUDDENLY SOMETHING THAT DOTH TURN ASIDE THROUGH VERY WONDER EVERY OTHER THOUGHT. A LADY ALL ALONE WHO WENT ALONG SINGING AND CULLING FLOWERET AFTER FLOWERET WITH WHICH HER PATHWAY WAS ALL PAINTED OVER. AH BEAUTEOUS LADY WHO IN RAYS OF LOVE DOST WARM THYSELF IF I MAY TRUST TO LOOKS WHICH THE HEART'S WITNESSES ARE WONT TO BE MAY THE DESIRE COME UNTO THEE TO DRAW NEAR TO THIS RIVER'S BANK I SAID TO HER SO MUCH THAT I MIGHT HEAR WHAT THOU ART SINGING. THOU MAKEST ME REMEMBER WHERE AND WHAT PROSERPINA THAT MOMENT WAS WHEN LOST HER MOTHER HER AND SHE HERSELF THE SPRING. AS TURNS HERSELF WITH FEET TOGETHER PRESSED AND TO THE GROUND A LADY WHO IS DANCING AND HARDLY PUTS ONE FOOT BEFORE THE OTHER ON THE VERMILION AND THE YELLOW FLOWERETS SHE TURNED TOWARDS ME NOT IN OTHER WISE THAN MAIDEN WHO HER MODEST EYES CASTS DOWN. AND MY ENTREATIES MADE TO BE CONTENT SO NEAR APPROACHING THAT THE DULCET SOUND CAME UNTO ME TOGETHER WITH ITS MEANING AS SOON AS SHE WAS WHERE THE GRASSES ARE. BATHED BY THE WATERS OF THE BEAUTEOUS RIVER TO LIFT HER EYES SHE GRANTED ME THE BOON. I DO NOT THINK THERE SHONE SO GREAT A LIGHT UNDER THE LIDS OF VENUS WHEN TRANSFIXED BY HER OWN SON BEYOND HIS USUAL CUSTOM. ERECT UPON THE OTHER BANK SHE SMILED BEARING FULL MANY COLOURS IN HER HANDS WHICH THAT HIGH LAND PRODUCES WITHOUT SEED. YE ARE NEW COMERS AND BECAUSE I SMILE BEGAN SHE PERADVENTURE IN THIS PLACE ELECT TO HUMAN NATURE FOR ITS NEST. SOME APPREHENSION KEEPS YOU MARVELLING BUT THE PSALM DELECTASTI GIVETH LIGHT WHICH HAS THE POWER TO UNCLOUD YOUR INTELLECT. AND THOU WHO FOREMOST ART AND DIDST ENTREAT ME SPEAK IF THOU WOULDST HEAR MORE FOR I CAME READY TO ALL THY QUESTIONINGS AS FAR AS NEEDFUL. THE WATER SAID I AND THE FOREST'S SOUND ARE COMBATING WITHIN ME MY NEW FAITH IN SOMETHING WHICH I HEARD OPPOSED TO THIS. WHENCE SHE I WILL RELATE HOW FROM ITS CAUSE PROCEEDETH THAT WHICH MAKETH THEE TO WONDER AND PURGE AWAY THE CLOUD THAT SMITES UPON THEE. THE GOOD SUPREME SOLE IN ITSELF DELIGHTING CREATED MAN GOOD AND THIS GOODLY PLACE GAVE HIM AS HANSEL OF ETERNAL PEACE. BY HIS DEFAULT SHORT WHILE HE SOJOURNED HERE BY HIS DEFAULT TO WEEPING AND TO TOIL HE CHANGED HIS INNOCENT LAUGHTER AND SWEET PLAY. THAT THE DISTURBANCE WHICH BELOW IS MADE BY EXHALATIONS OF THE LAND AND WATER WHICH FAR AS MAY BE FOLLOW AFTER HEAT MIGHT NOT UPON MANKIND WAGE ANY WAR THIS MOUNT ASCENDED TOW'RDS THE HEAVEN SO HIGH AND IS EXEMPT FROM THERE WHERE IT IS LOCKED
