AND WHEN THE CAR WAS OPPOSITE TO ME THUNDER WAS HEARD AND ALL THAT FOLK AUGUST SEEMED TO HAVE FURTHER PROGRESS INTERDICTED. THERE WITH THE VANWARD ENSIGNS STANDING STILL. MOTIONLESS HALTED THE VERACIOUS PEOPLE THAT CAME AT FIRST BETWEEN IT AND THE GRIFFIN TURNED THEMSELVES TO THE CAR AS TO THEIR PEACE. AND ONE OF THEM AS IF BY HEAVEN COMMISSIONED SINGING VENI SPONSA DE LIBANO SHOUTED THREE TIMES AND ALL THE OTHERS AFTER. EVEN AS THE BLESSED AT THE FINAL SUMMONS SHALL RISE UP QUICKENED EACH ONE FROM HIS CAVERN UPLIFTING LIGHT THE REINVESTED FLESH. AND THE SUN'S FACE UPRISING OVERSHADOWED SO THAT BY TEMPERING INFLUENCE OF VAPOURS FOR A LONG INTERVAL THE EYE SUSTAINED IT. AS SOON AS ON MY VISION SMOTE THE POWER SUBLIME THAT HAD ALREADY PIERCED ME THROUGH ERE FROM MY BOYHOOD I HAD YET COME FORTH. TO THE LEFT HAND I TURNED WITH THAT RELIANCE WITH WHICH THE LITTLE CHILD RUNS TO HIS MOTHER WHEN HE HAS FEAR OR WHEN HE IS AFFLICTED. TO SAY UNTO VIRGILIUS NOT A DRACHM OF BLOOD REMAINS IN ME THAT DOES NOT TREMBLE I KNOW THE TRACES OF THE ANCIENT FLAME. BUT US VIRGILIUS OF HIMSELF DEPRIVED HAD LEFT VIRGILIUS SWEETEST OF ALL FATHERS VIRGILIUS TO WHOM I FOR SAFETY GAVE ME. NOR WHATSOEVER LOST THE ANCIENT MOTHER AVAILED MY CHEEKS NOW PURIFIED FROM DEW THAT WEEPING THEY SHOULD NOT AGAIN BE DARKENED. DANTE BECAUSE VIRGILIUS HAS DEPARTED DO NOT WEEP YET DO NOT WEEP YET AWHILE FOR BY ANOTHER SWORD THOU NEED'ST MUST WEEP. E'EN AS AN ADMIRAL WHO ON POOP AND PROW COMES TO BEHOLD THE PEOPLE THAT ARE WORKING IN OTHER SHIPS AND CHEERS THEM TO WELL DOING. UPON THE LEFT HAND BORDER OF THE CAR WHEN AT THE SOUND I TURNED OF MY OWN NAME WHICH OF NECESSITY IS HERE RECORDED. I SAW THE LADY WHO EREWHILE APPEARED VEILED UNDERNEATH THE ANGELIC FESTIVAL DIRECT HER EYES TO ME ACROSS THE RIVER. ALTHOUGH THE VEIL THAT FROM HER HEAD DESCENDED ENCIRCLED WITH THE FOLIAGE OF MINERVA DID NOT PERMIT HER TO APPEAR DISTINCTLY IN ATTITUDE STILL ROYALLY MAJESTIC CONTINUED SHE LIKE UNTO ONE WHO SPEAKS AND KEEPS HIS WARMEST UTTERANCE IN RESERVE. LOOK AT ME WELL IN SOOTH I'M BEATRICE. HOW DIDST THOU DEIGN TO COME UNTO THE MOUNTAIN DIDST THOU NOT KNOW THAT MAN IS HAPPY HERE. MINE EYES FELL DOWNWARD INTO THE CLEAR FOUNTAIN BUT SEEING MYSELF THEREIN I SOUGHT THE GRASS SO GREAT A SHAME DID WEIGH MY FOREHEAD DOWN. AS TO THE SON THE MOTHER SEEMS SUPERB SO SHE APPEARED TO ME FOR SOMEWHAT BITTER TASTETH THE SAVOUR OF SEVERE COMPASSION. SILENT BECAME SHE AND THE ANGELS SANG SUDDENLY IN TE DOMINE SPERAVI BUT BEYOND PEDES MEOS DID NOT PASS. EVEN AS THE SNOW AMONG THE LIVING RAFTERS UPON THE BACK OF ITALY CONGEALS BLOWN ON AND DRIFTED BY SCLAVONIAN WINDS AND THEN DISSOLVING TRICKLES THROUGH ITSELF WHENE'ER THE LAND THAT LOSES SHADOW BREATHES SO THAT IT SEEMS A FIRE THAT MELTS A TAPER. E'EN THUS WAS I WITHOUT A TEAR OR SIGH BEFORE THE SONG OF THOSE WHO SING FOR EVER AFTER THE MUSIC OF THE ETERNAL SPHERES. BUT WHEN I HEARD IN THEIR SWEET MELODIES COMPASSION FOR ME MORE THAN HAD THEY SAID O WHEREFORE LADY DOST THOU THUS UPBRAID HIM. THE ICE THAT WAS ABOUT MY HEART CONGEALED TO AIR AND WATER CHANGED AND IN MY ANGUISH THROUGH MOUTH AND EYES CAME GUSHING FROM MY BREAST. SHE ON THE RIGHT HAND BORDER OF THE CAR STILL FIRMLY STANDING TO THOSE HOLY BEINGS THUS HER DISCOURSE DIRECTED AFTERWARDS. YE KEEP YOUR WATCH IN THE ETERNAL DAY SO THAT NOR NIGHT NOR SLEEP CAN STEAL FROM YOU ONE STEP THE AGES MAKE UPON THEIR PATH
